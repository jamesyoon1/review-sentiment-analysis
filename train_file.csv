-1,I repeat my order times in the drive thru and she still manage to mess it up it was suppose to be a large meal double filet of fish with large fries no cheese It was all wrong they either need to pay close attention to the order being made understand English or they need not to work at a drive thru
-1,I work for door dash and they locked us all out to wait in a long line for no reason at I tried to beg them to open it because I m door dash and they refused Covid is over get a new job
-1,If I could give this location a zero on customer service I would Pulled into drive through at and placed a simple order I order a regular hamburg and cookies Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up I was told to pull up to the space I sat there and sat there and minutes later no order I went in and no one was at the counter I yelled hello three times A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter A young girl appeared To make this complaint shorter I showed my receipt and another minutes later I got my order There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it After getting home I had no regular hamburg but had cookies Everyone don t even bother going to this location again It s a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews 
-1,Came in and ordered a Large coffee w no ice They handed me a cup that was less than half way full I asked the employee Flor if they could give me a Large coffee w no ice and she said no I was willing to pay more to get a full cup of coffee I always get a large sweet tea w no ice and it 
-1,Went thru drive thru Ordered Getting home noticed my piece nuggets where missing Tried calling the restaurant and nothing The lady gave me a hard time about extra sauce Very unhappy 
-1,Worst McDonald 
-1,The morning crew seems fast and efficient Night crew is a whole different experience lines down the street hour long waits If this was a one time occurrence it wouldn t be so bad but this is a nightly problem Beyond this the staff is so highly rude you leave wanting to crash your car through the building Don t forget they will mistake your order almost every single time as well and serve it to you cold 
-1,Ordered food burger wrong and left out part of the order also One of the drink cup lid not fattened Poor service girl handing order at window on January at pm 
-1,The boy who attended me made me wait and when he saw that the drink was wrong he threw the bag of food at me with a grimace So disappointed 
-1,I am not happy at all today I went and bought Strawberry Banana smoothies and and hash browns and my smoothies tasted like straight ice and water smh And I am very disappointed in there service my smoothie should never taste like that never especially the fact I bought it for not only me but my kids I need someone to contact me from corporate or something I am not happy at all waste of money 
-1,Can t believe experience with order taker Went from drive thru and employee directly asks what do you want He keeps rushing while taking order with no other cars placing order We wanted to add one more item and asked for a minute He keeps asking what else When I said we are ready no response There were no other car placing order that time either I told again we are ready responded after a pause Again what do you want excuse me who talks to customers like this I asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied I asked for receipt before handing my credit card He swipes it and returns back my card I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car He starts inputing another order on his tablet Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times He opens window and said you can get receipt from next window Excuse me Went to next window picked up food asked for Manager and got his name JAMAR My receipt states pm Order I didn t want to complain but this was intolerable 
-1,Meh just meh When I finally get the correct order it is generally tasty I m a picky eater and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like Worked in the service industry for years as a server bartender and trainer Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard tedious at times though I only go here when I see they are not busy in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave In the times that I have been here in the past past year I have only had order that was perfectly correct Just ONE not an exaggeration That one order was just large fries and nothing else Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag they were hardly what you d call filled nor did I enjoy any on the minute drive home so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald s on Facebook at least the few were hot The evening staff is very pleasant but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which being a light skinned Puerto Rican I understand perfectly I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back I just don t go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong 
-1,This is consistently the worst meal you will pay for Microwaved nuggets cold fries and a minute wait What more can you ask for Dont go here ever Your better off going hungry or giving the meal you payed for to the homeless by the donation box behind the drive thru

-1,Normally this location does pretty good but last night was absolutely ridiculous I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line When i got to the window they told me they couldn t take it and I d have to go back around I told them I d like to put in my order here since I ve been waiting all this time and they proceeded to still refuse and that it s my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out The second lane was open and the sign they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive thru menu I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me and then slammed the drive thru window shut I ve never received such deplorable customer service in my life and if any managers are reading this I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night 
-1,I went to this location tonight to see if they could give me the Oreo Mcflurry that a different McDonald s had forgotten earlier they completely refused Unbelievable It s ice cream 
-1,Rude customer service unprofessional attitude overcooked food no complimentary items for screwing up our orders I don t understand how you can keep your job when there is so many negative reviews I vow to never eat here again I would rather eat a cold can of baked beans 
-1,Representative was very rude and disrespectful refused fulfilling my order and simply hung up on me on the drive through window never was I so disappointed at that location before Manager pretended like nothing even happened 
-1,I went to pick up food from the restaurant at late night through drive through I was told to wait near the door and I will be getting the order but even after waiting minutes no one came with the food Orders are already assigned and even after coming through drive through it takes more than half an hour to get it which is not good Lots of people behind me got the food but no one cared about the driver who is already waiting from long time Thank you
-1,The manager IS RUDE at research Blvd in north Austin TX HAD TO GO BACK INTO THE DINER TIMES AND THE RD TIME THE MANAGER DIDNT EVEN ACKOWLEDGE WE WERE EVEN THERE DISCRIPTION OF SAID MANAGER SPANISH ABOUT FT TALL AND HAD LONG BLONDOISH HAIR PULLED BACK INTO A PONY TAIL READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND THRY WERE NOT GOOD NEED TO CHECK OUT WHAT IS GOING ON

-1,Got Wrong order 
-1,So Uber eats was having connectivity issues and pushed an order through to this location that was supposed to be cancelled I know this isnt McDonald s fault but when I called McDonalds to try and address the issue they answered and then ignored me and must have left their phone off the hook because any attempt to call them after this got me only dial tone I know places are short staffed but you cant just ignore people 
-1,If I paid for a large sized meal and I asked for both a large fry and a large drink please don t argue with me that the ticket says medium drink Thank you so much from a single parent who just wanted to spend a little bit of money on unhealthy food for wasting my hard earned money

-1,waited in the drive through for over half an hour all i got for my trouble was a sorry for the wait not even an explanation When I got to the second window there were at least a dozen sodas just sitting on the counter It s not the first time I ve had bad service I once pulled up and they just said we re not serving right now even though it was smack dab in the middle of the day hours 
-1,When you specifically say plain AND dry and then just to make sure they understood cuz let s face it it s MacDonalds you add so nothing but the meat and buns Then you get home open the bag and immediately see the cheese through the hamburger wrapper I mean for cryin
-1,Buyer beware Yeah it s fast food and cheap However if you love to be consistently let down this particular location is the place to frequent This location loves to give you incorrect items and of the time your order will be missing something Please be sure to check your order prior to leaving the premises Do note that it takes forever to get them to correct their mistakes so do take into consideration that the rest of your food will be cold and soggy by the time
-1, AM on a Saturday and they just straight up stopped answering the drive through They just sitting in there chilling
-1,Awful experience Drive thru attendants are rude untrained and unprofessional When asked for a manager the attendants lie and say that there isn t one on duty FYI impossible for every shift not to have a manager One specific attendant screamed and cursed at me to which led me to contact corporate 
-1,I ordered happy meals with plain cheeseburgers All the burgers were wrong Do you know what it s like to have four grandkids that can 
-1,McDonalds is NOT a fast food company anymore They re just a food company now Always a line wrapped around the building that never moves When are robots going to replace the kitchen staff who hate their jobs 
-1,This McDonalds CONSTANTLY gets orders wrong We have ordered at the window and over uber and EVERY SINGLE TIME we dont get a complete order Today we went back to get our fry we had chicken sandwiches and fry not complicated at all The manager gave us a new one but the girl at the oick up window shoved the bag in ny hands and when I tha ked her she made a rude face and turned away 
-1,Night time drive through team seem really unprofessional I ordered a meal with an extra fry but when I got to the food window was only given the fry with the meal I mentioned the extra fry and was told I only paid for fry I offered to pay the difference for the extra fry but was told I needed to drive back around and order again Seriously That s the response Will not be returning 
-1,This is the rd time in a row that we ve been burned going through the drive threw Each time they have messed up our order and you d think by now that I would have learned my lesson but I thought this would be quick and easy NOPE This location sucks I tried calling the number in the receipt but no one answers I know I can 
-1,Worst experience All I asked for was a regular size coffee I get to the window and was handed a small I asked the woman if that was a regular to which she rudely said yes I questioned her again two more times then I asked her how many sizes of coffee they had she said small medium and large I asked her which one was the one I was holding and she said it s a small that s what we charged you for she said and I told her I asked for a regular which would be a medium but I just drove off Also asked for splendas and creamers on the side and received regular sugars and creamers To top it off coffee was full of coffee grounds to the point I was spitting them out And as a little plus there was a piece of plastic Never again 
-1,Attempted to go through the drive thru at am It said it was hour however no one seemed to be taking orders and I drove around twice just in case and tried again but still no answer I saw one employee in the kitchen but couldn t get his attention Very bad business If closed or delayed in opening then at least a sign that indicates that would have been nice 
-1,My burger was completely raw in the middle and when I took the burger back in to get it remade the lady behind the counter treated me like I was some stuck up brat for not wanting to eat a raw burger If I had the ability to give them a zero star rating I would I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN 
-1,If I could give negative stars I would This location is the absolute worst ever Every single time I go they f up my order Then give attitude when they need to correct their mistakes I Try to give the benefit of the doubt everyone has off bad days so I return thinking this time will be different but it never is They always suck The staff is horrible Corporate needs to send all their staff over to a week of training at chic fil A college to learn about work ethic time management teamwork and basic manors I am baffled how chic fil a can have cars in drive thru and get my order right the first time and under mins But at McDonald s there could be cars and it still takes mins and tries to get my order right makes no logical sense Moral of rant save your time and money and drive around the corner to chic fil a they got your
-1,When ordering food the employees conveniently forgot to turn off their microphones and were talking mess about all the food we had ordered this is very unprofessional and honestly uncalled for When I asked for a receipt they said it was in the bad and it was convenient not in there I ve trying to get ahold of management to speak ab

-1,Horrible customer service always gets my order wrong They were out of French fries so I said that s fine I can wait while you make more We can t do that seriously what kind of fast food place can t make fries It only takes two minutes and to heat up even the worst fryer Which I would have waited for Is this not the money making industry My business is now sitting at Whataburger who also doesn t have fries ready but said I could have some fresh in two minutes 
-1,The most horrible service yet Drive thru can t get a dam thing right at all has no interest in his voice I have to continue to repeat myself for you to still get it wrong Then when I went through drive threw they still can t follow directions So sad

-1,Nothing Staff was rude No napkins out tables were dirty My son and I went in at to get lunch before a movie knowing lunch starts at They apparently don t serve lunch until When I asked why she said because people like late breakfast on weekends Why that affects lunch I don t know According to the sign breakfast is served all day Had I read the reviews first I would have gone to the one across the highway 
-1,Your general fast food place with subpar service Went here one morning to get a quick breakfast because we had no time for our usual Saturday morning spot We ordered several different breakfast items and at the end my wife went to order a single order of three pancakes and sausage breakfast for one of the kids At checkout it seemed expensive at first the cashier never repeated the order back to us When we received our order we figured out why She put us down for three total three pancakes and sausage breakfasts When my wife brought it up the girl behind the register just said oops sorry and walked away no offer to fix it or give a refund Great job 
-1,Let s just say this place would be a lot better if they had a different crew member There is a orange red hair lady names Veronica who does the window mostly and she ALWAYS has a attitude If you don t want to work at McDonalds then gone because their are people who take customer service 
-1,I didn t used to mind this McD s I was happy there was an option for hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late night munchies During the day it s a pretty average McD s But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at am pulled up to the order box waited for five minutes then finally someone came over the speaker and said Sorry we re closed Closed It s hrs And I get it sometimes hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning I get that I really do But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you re not blind sided by it Not this place I really don t think they were closed I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing Additionally this store has a bad habit of having a broken ice cream machine past pm It s always sorry ice cream machine is broken if you come in after the lobby closes The worst part is I complained on the website I submitted a complaint for this store pointing out the hr and the ice cream issue All I got back weeks later was oh sorry the ice cream machine was broken we re working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time Not even a single MENTION of the closed hr location As I said it s a pretty standard McD s which is synonymous with lazy but this one takes the cake on it 
-1,They tried to charge me for a piece of egg when I asked for a bacon egg and cheese McGriddle through the drive thru I went inside and the manager tried to charge me when her employee never confirmed my order All I said was sub bacon instead of the sausage and somehow the egg got taken off I don

-1,I found pieces of hair in my food I also had to Pay for pancake syrup and ranch and when I open the bag they were already open and leaking into my bag When I called to make a complaint the manager Did not answer it took calls back to back an he was incredibly rude He told me that everyone there has passed their certification and if I don t like it I can go to the health department I have made a complaint with the Texas health department Floors are disgusting bathrooms are disgusting This is the worst McDonald s I have ever been to in my life and I have traveled all over this country 
-1,One star because everytime I go early in the morning this lady is always so rude Granted I know its early but if u can t handle being up this early then maybe you should consider getting a different job It s not okay to be rude 
-1,Asked me to wait at spot one Asked for jelly and was completely ignored Had to go inside to get it myself Trash customer service I blame management for not holding anyone accountable 
-1,seriously I had asked specifically no onion on both of my steak bagels meals when I got to my house they both had onions and I had asked for picante sauce and they didn t even put sauce packets in my bag it just sucks getting home and not being able to eat what you expected 
-1,The personal are really nice but everytime I go there they almost mess my order Sometimes I pay extra for my extra toppings and They forgot to add the topings they made it just plain And like in the bacon mcd double I always order that one for my daughter with only mayo en they add mac sause and she is allergic to onions And there is always something missing in my order 
-1,The inside smells like baby diapers When you ask for extra sweet and sour sauce they give you a dirty look like it is such a hassle The ice cream machine is always broken and the food always looks like it was put together so carelessly Guess you can t expect much from a McDonald s anyways 
-1,They are always rude and get mad when they mess your order up I ve never been to such a bad service place
-1,One of the worst places I ve ever been to Messed up almost every single item I ordered Phone lines don 
-1,Seriously what is the deal with not being able to brew fresh sweet tea It s sad that you have to check your drinks before you leave the drive thru It seems as if time a week we get bad tea from this location It s not like we can just leave work to go get a new one either We send my hubby on a drink run in the morning and he constantly forgets to take the taste test before he leaves but he should not have to 
-1,Literally the only thing they did not mess up was the drinks The frys were old and barely filled halfway and we ordered a large the only condiment we asked for was ketchup didn

-1,So bad they had to re engineer their quarter pounder It was great then they went cheapo now they added some extra fat to the mix They take their fortune for granted It s really sad Great fries though if you don t get a bag of soggy burnt tip one inchers I ve learned to distrust the compnay

-1,I eat fast food maybe once a month Have been to this McDonalds about a dozen times the past couple years and literally every single time I ve been there they have screwed something up These people can t even count FFS as they gave me TWO crispy tenders in my four piece It s mind boggling Not to mention they are ALWAYS out of at least one item I order and the drive thru involves pulling off and waiting for minutes every single time even if there is no one in the place Complete and utter disgrace 
-1,Other than maybe a missing order usually very nice place but I ordered a Quarter Pounder meal for my yr old child and she bit into raw meat 
-1,If they took the grease off the burger it would be the pounder but the grease soften the rock hard bun must have been left over from and don t even get me started on the fries If I wouldn t be arrested for assault I would have thrown it at them Good thing I had the granddaughter with me

-1,Went through the drive thru at around after coming off a hour shift Ordered a Big Mac med fry and a water Got home and took one bite of the Big Mac the bread absorbed so much grease that I had grease dripping from both of my hands The grease from the burger had absorbed into the bread so much that I squeezed the bread and grease dripped from it The frys were not at all fresh I threw my meal in the trash where it belonged Called the store and spoke with John He apologized and took my name down and I will get a refund but it doesnt help my hunger NOW Worst encounter with McDonalds ever And this is why I dont eat there I ll choose Burger King next time The carelessness of the staff there really shows and the food they produced tonight was among the worst I have ever seen in the food industry 
-1,Ok so I went through the drive through So as usual I checked to make sure everything was their The past experience has tough me to do this Nothing like getting home and surprise something is missing To my surprise for a salad rotten lettuce and dried out carrots The salad was dated tomorrow It should have been thrown out like I did two days Had I seen it at the counter I wouldn t have bought it Must be the tariff has kicked in on potatoes The were very few fries About a good size hand full What was with the barbecue sauce in the bottom of the bag These owner operates crying poverty all the way to 
-1,Worst mcdonald s around Workers are rude and the orders are always wrong And don t even think about complaining Because they will get in your face and curse at you Very unprofessional Don t waste your time going there food is cold most of the time or you re missing an item Needs to be shut down 
-1,By far the worst of the franchise This location does not sell McDonald s recipes or guidelines times i made a u turn for over salted fries that can t be eaten for the amount of salt put on them The burgers are not built to McD recipes they appear slopped together and backwards To top it off the packing is without care They mix multiple orders in different bags where another petson has to dig food out of another bagto putmy meal together This is serious ignorance laziness and incompetence management to say the least Need more prople to contact corporate about this location 
-1,According to both Google and the corporate website the drive thru at this location is hours I have gone there multiple times recently to find cars parked in the lot lights on in the building and the drive thru signs lit only to wait several minutes with no acknowledgment I even pulled around to the window and honked and still received no response

-1,I dont like MacDonalds in NY Has a horrible attendance and this thing of asking to open the bathroom to be able to use is not pleasant On one occasion my niece went to make the request for all and the security said that if we were not going to buy nothing was to vacate the table 
-1,This is the worst McDonald s in New York City The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in They nod off and just buy a soda or water to occupy the table for hours There s homeless in front of the McDonald s and to the side and inside there s a lot of shady individuals that are just sitting there coming down off heroin highs The service is mediocre and the atmosphere is gross For it to be across the street from NYU this should be a whole nother level of security and quality 
-1,Absolutely horrid customer service and even though I have lower expectations for a McDonald s in food quality this has particularly bare food taste and is often served sloppily Eye contact is optional in their employee training apparently 
-1,They have a security guard who has the key of the restroom and he thinks he owns it he got upset because I was holding the door for my friend to use it cuz he was waiting too as I did the security guard doesn t come until am so if you buy something before that you are not able to use the restroom until he comes the bathroom doesn t look from inside means that anybody can open the restroom while you still using it he also was arresting us cuz my friend took a little bit longer in the restroom and he ask me if my friend smokes I think that unprofessional

-1,My daughter and I stopped in for a quick bite about on Saturday th We were charged for something that should have been free The young female supervisor or manager that had to take care of the refund was very rude and unapologetic for their mistake The worst customer service I ve had in that square in years Perhaps when they did the remodel they should have gotten rid of the terrible staff as well Come on McDonald s you can do better than that Please take some pride and have expectations for your employees serving your public Terrible place I truly hope they fire that supervisor trust me she s not worth the money she s being paid

-1,Extremely rude staff but don t think much of it the people seem to be totally exploited by their horrible Hong Kong boss Pity 
-1,I don t know if I could give a start less than The security of this establishment is a rude non friendly and a cruel person I felt completely unsafe with this person around me he heckled me and acted as if seats were reserved in this establishment he was singing and tapping his foot like a mad man It is safe to avoid this restaurant if you don t want to suffer a racist encounter Deeply disappointed that an establishment like McDonalds would hire people like this guy
-1,Apparently people are not permitted to go to the washroom clean up and reset prior to ordering I like my food hot and don t agree with this store policy The manager wouldn t acknowledge me beyond a smirk I asked for permission she said nothing but a worker from behind the counter restated the policy A quarter mile away my preferred sequence worked golden Literally a STUPID policy implemented by that store and manager 
-1,Security was nice and open the door for my sister and I to enter I got on the line to make a purchase and my sister went to use the bathroom She informed me of a worker or manager sitting down harassing her for a receipt just to use the bathroom All the workers are hard at work and this lady is sitting down asking for a receipt If there s a customer only restroom why not
-1,One of the dirtiest worst McDonalds in the city Absolutely abysmal wait times overworked understaffed workers HORRIBLE manager This particular manager I think she s Ecuadorian needs to be replaced or fired as she is rude doesn 
-1,My girlfriend and her friends visited this establishment on at around AM An African American worker in a grey shirt Male with braided hair was incredibly racist to her and her friends using an Asian accent when talking to them He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra While this was happening all of the other employees laughed and egged him on My girlfriend and her friends felt very unsafe especially late at night We will try filing a police report today with the local precinct and hope this employee faces consequences 
-1,Most of the ordering machines were broken There was only one cashier so the line moved incredibly slow They refused to refill my ice tea even though the other drinks were refillable through the machine Prices were expensive 
-1,We went there during NYE just prior to the ball drop The surprising thing was there was homeless folks inside the store walking and smoking next to us when we were preparing to eat The homeless guy was even asking for food to someone next to us It felt very much like a rd world country s experience The tables were dirty as well maybe they need to hire more people for cleaning in between customers The French fries were cold as well as if they were probably heated long time ago Also the store associates should provide a tray for customers who are going to be sitting eating inside the store instead of paper packets for takeouts 
-1,Horrible customer service Especially the managment treat everyone as if they re lower than them no consideration whatsoever I ve been waiting mi
-1,Horrible People around food coughing I got a refund asap I m not getting sick for no one How you giving out the food in the front coughing without covering your mouth Cough just spreading You can not make this up Make it make sense What sad is that people need to do better If this was my business it is no way I would want anyone in my establishments like this What s the point of having a mask on if it is on your chin Than you have the other woman she had her mask on but she kept coughing every other minute Sounding like she coughing up a lung All I wa

-1,Manager security gard working on was extremely unpleasant and screamed at us Store was dirty and a health hazard Don t go there 
-1,Only people working in back all cashes are closed because they don t have enough people You have to use the machine to order Waited mins for my Mcflurry Managers should be ashamed that they didn t help these employees 
-1,Employees make many mistakes and it s patrons that hang out there many are addicts 
-1,The male cashier was lazy and rude and tried to charge me the higher prices The hamburgers I ordered were cold COLD Worse they did not contain the extra pickles I requested times Yes x The Apple pies were not only cold but worse had been clearly sitting out all day and were so over cooked I just spit them out and into the garbage less than bite The chicken sandwich was not hot either and worse it was waaaay overly smeared with unhealthy mayo which I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping dollars and cents I WANT A REFUND PLEASE FINALLY this crowded McDonald s was the filthiest and dirtiest one I ve ever been in So very very sad and disappointed Respectfully submitted Timothy Ernest 
-1,I was there this morning am Trying to order a biscuit and hashbrown Like every day today this lady lost her mind told me to use the big screen to order and get receipts She was doing nothing but standing there she don t want to take my order and keep telling me use the screen and refuse to help me i verbally confronted her there I left without my breakfast If people like her keep working for your well known establishment you loose and get defame your good name because people like her Teach her some manners how to behave with people ho come to your restaurant to have good time She act like I was a homeless person I hope you can do something about this incident Have a good day But I will not have good day because I will continue thinking about what happened this morning with me at your place

-1,Apparently there s a bouncer for
-1,Disgusting just bought a burger with mold on it 
-1,I ve been more than patient with this place I understand this is a tough area to work because I work near this restaurant At this point closing so early randomly is unacceptable It s like you are gambling with the little time you have for break And the site says hours and still no dining They have security so dodging the seedy types should not be an issue here 
-1,I have never seen such a disgraceful service in my life workers are very rude That woman at the cash register shouldn t be standing there should get out of work You can t treat customers like dogs who are you 
-1, Despite the fact that it s front sign explicitly says Open they unethically keep the doors tide shut from the inside based on a made up rule that you have to show proof of an order from your phone Even if your phone is dead in the middle of the night and you re starving they still won t let you simply walk inside to order like everyone else in America This is place is bad for business DON T bother 
-1,Terrible experience Filthy No soda at all Staff could not have been ruder if they tried 
-1,Security worker said we could not eat our food inside and was very disrespectful started taking a video of us and making rude comments while doing so Made us go outside during a severe thunderstorm after purchasing our food No sign saying anything about no eating inside the restaurant Guy just had a power trip and probably upset how his life sucks
-1,very very dirty and broken tables and benches
-1,It stank in this facility How is food even served
-1,Horrible Avoid this place at night Unsafe Panhandling at the counter and hooligans will take your food the second it is ready for pick up they won t even call your number Staff and security could care less 
-1,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NO NOT GO THERE ONE OF THE WORST MC IN THE CITY EVERY MORNING THEY NEVER HAVE MOBILE OR REGISTERS ITS SUCH A INCONVENIENCE LIKE WHY ARE YOU OPEN 
-1,Supervisor is a mean person that every time she has a argument somebody get hurt is really incompetent and if I m lying look for all there latest news And you will find tha the first with her and a client and it end security harming people I am so sorry to say this I was a suing manager in McDonald s when I was younger and there are better ways to handle situations 
-1, Payment Warning The non American foreigners who run this restaurant is the only McDonald s in United States that do not accept Discover Card for payment 
-1,If I could give zero stars I would This place is supposed to be open hours but they tell you at midnight their closed and tie the doors shut with what looks like a sweater after you ve placed an order T
-1,Worst service I ever experienced I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically I will never be going to that establishment again 
-1,This is what I encountered when I came to this location today A trash bag wrapped around the door by the security guard to stop ppl from coming in So instead of a safe warm location to order and pickup from I had to wait on a very dangerous Avenue in NYC while they took their sweet time in making my order minutes to make breakfast and having to wait on a dangerous street is ABSOLUTELY APPALING
-1,They were careful about maintaining social distancing an encouraging sign However because of the nature of the area and the poor getting poorer and the homeless getting braver several times while waiting on line to order and to pick up seemingly homeless desperate people came in begging some pretending to order some appeared to be casing the customers It was disturbing to say the least On top of all of that the meals I had ordered were cold and the french fries limp and cold I would never go there again 
-1,Slow late night weekend workers especially the female worker it seems like she doesn t wanna work highly doubt any s
-1,Full of dropouts Take care
-1,I just purchase sandwiches here today I got a McChicken and a McDouble Both of these used to be on the Dollar Menu Now they are on the Menu and they are each The McChicken had Mayo only on a far side and it was all over the wrapper and top of the bun Almost NONE was in the sandwich I ate it though but it tasted funny The McDouble was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE The bread was stale and hard The meat was cold It was a out of burger It was that bad I couldn t eat it so I threw it away I wish I could get my money back McDonalds is a failure at this point 
-1,I always come here to get something quick while I work It drives me crazy when I forget to check my food before I leave the restaurant because when I get back to work the food is so old It s so sad that you have to check your food before you leave I ordered McChickens They were so old and hard that I literally had to just eat the bread because I 
-1,This McDonalds location is HORRIBLE They work very slow during the night morning hours forcing customers to use the Kios machine and everyone don 
-1,This McDonald s is straight up trash The one on th and th is better Went at a bad time cause it seems like their systems was down Only the kiosk was working Sad thing is I had asked the lady if they had ice cream She asked the manager manager said no Next

-1,The security guy was very rude He was on his phone while I approached him and asked if it was possible to use the restroom He was rude and said that I can use only with a purchase which I agreed to I humbly asked if I can use the restroom first before I make the purchase and he raised his voice at me and said u keep asking me the same thing No humanity 
-1,Staff member made a mistake which we didn t realise until back at our hotel Returned to pick up the missing salad and drink rude member of staff who ignored us so we went to the collect desk that staff member ignored us too so we followed her she told us to go to the other woman We refused and requested she deal with us We had no receipt just the ticket number they had taken the receipt with the initial order Eventually gave in and tried to give us the original drink erm if we had been trying to con them how would we know the drink was there just sat on the side going cold Anyway don 
-1,I ve never left a review in my life but I had to for this location The security guard on staff tonight in this location was horrible to say the least The lack in customer service and decency is appalling I ve never walked into a business where the security guard is finding any issue he can to cause a scene and I ve never seen a 
-1,Overcharging customers with their uninformed prices then management does aid to the issue with accommodating the customer with the stated price 
-1,Our chicken biscuit sandwiches were awful the chicken was overcooked we couldn t eat it ended up throwing it in the garbage I wish I had took a picture of it
-1,This location constantly serves stale food have received hard burnt overcooked sandwiches and freezer burned chicken tenders Even though it says open hours I ve been told turned away at AM AM and even as early as PM a couple of weeks ago I had to wait an hour on food after the kiosks malfunctioned and my order disappeared in their system and the people working wouldn t even hook me up with a large fry instead of a medium after waiting so long This location just can 
-1,Cant use restroom without paying
-1,Dirty several people trying to sleep at tables no vaccine check We were desperate for food drinks but believe this was where we contracted covid Currently in quarantine on ship

-1,Very crowded you will probably catch covid from the first seconds of being in here you can t even walk in here too many people it seems like the kids get out of school and go here too and terrorize the place
-1,Nasty Gnats flying around the trash can The trash bin was so full people started leaving trash by the drink station Security talking on the phone They need to pay attention to the dining area I was highly dissatisfied
-1,I ve loved the original McChicken since it was introduced in the s when I was a baby But getting that McChicken from midtown it was so bland and felt rushed I ate it of course but still it tasted bad compared to the original McChicken
-1,Do not go after pm The store was trashed and dirty and staff moved liked they d just smoked a spliff Very slow and had to repeat my order which was on cups of coffee Try to avoid this place like the plague 
-1,Because the female security guard that works for you is very very nasty and very unprofessional She throws of the people out for no reason She has told the workers behind the counter not to take my order and not to serve me She has not yet been able to give anyone a reason as to why she is putting me out Majority of the people who come there She has done the same thing to She was once the warden at rikers island but she was caught in the big drug ring letting the other correction officers bring in the drugs so now she is working in McDonald s She has threatened me and has been harnessing myself and at least other people I have called the police and they told me to call McDonald s corporate number Something has to be done about her She has no right treating people like this
-1,Today date is time pm just walked in to use the bathroom and was told by a security guy that I couldn t use the bathroom unless I buy something He had a key from the bathroom and was sitting right next to the bathroom I said ok and then looked for a manager The manager had confirmed that you had to buy something to use a bathroom But for me she would do a favor by letting me t
-1,Boy this placr was scary
-1,It s unfortunate that this location is the closet to me The staff really sucks here From the lack of smiling hospitality and there s absolutely no thank you at the end of paying for your meal and no apologies when they give you the wrong order they just hastily take the next customer Even the cleaning crew sucks I asked to be let into the bathroom and he looked at me with a blank expression There is NO diversity what so ever Only Spanish speaking crew members what a shame 
-1,I wish I could give it a no star My purse got robbed inside the store and I asked the manager if he can please show me for video evidence he approached me by saying No ask those ladies raising his voice at me and walked away How helpful was the manager 
-1,This place in particular is a complete mess And that day I went in was a Saturday afternoon it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place I believe there s a Rehabilitation Center near by and that s the reason But however I DON T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE unless you order to take out 
-1,The meal was good but there were to many homeless people and beggars inside this McDonalds The beggars where fairly aggressive impertinent and well prepared for tourists They wanted to push a brasilian woman next to my table to give them She wanted to give them but they tried to argue with her for minutes It was more like threatening than arguing I was so pissed of after this experience The food is great but the management should take care about this situation and protect their guests especially tourists 
-1,I was waiting in line with my six year old son who had to go to the bathroom The security guard was sitting down talking to a customer I knocked on the door and realized there was no one inside So I asked him to open the door He told me that if I did not have attitude he could do it faster Then he opened the door and said Black people always have attitudes He proceeded to curse at I went to talk to the manager who pretty much ignored me and continued cooking French fries I called the corporate number This was by far the worse experience I have ever had in a McDonald 
-1,Security person didn t let me use the restroom without showing a receipt I said the line is long and I have to go man I d be buying something after I use the restroom I promise he said no so now I m writing this from the pizzeria next door after using the restroom two slices and a juice Thinking of going here Go nextdoor 
-1,I was disgusted and appolled by this mcdonalds i would suggest NEVER go here Walked in to the staff and security guard having a loud conversation or arguement im not sure but after hearing the N word times and standing there not being greeted i left I felt unsafe and the staff were truly ghetto and extremely irresponsible work ethic respect If your a tourist avoid this location 
-1,Soooo slow Came here to try and get a quick burger before my train min for departure and these guys suck No sense of urgency It s supposed to be fast food nothing in this place is fast Missed my train by min with me running to Penn the whole way from here Garbage is the sum up for this location If you re thinking about getting something quick before your travels look elsewhere You re better off going hungry than waiting for these lazy employees to do their job 
-1,This place had garbage on the tables and floors It looked like a section soup kitchen in there Understaffed with unprofessional delinquents they have their street friends coming from behind the counter after hanging out in the kitchen while tons of people were waiting for their food 
-1,Turns out McDonald 
-1,The security hear are a hassle You can t eat in peace I have a digestive problem and she is watching her clock She s unprofessional and disrespectful to paying customers She is pushing out You need to address her aproach And how to handle the customers here 
-1,Ordered McNuggets through the electronic menu and they made me select sauces but none were given in the order The nuggets were dry and overcooked especially without any sauce They also took my receipt when I wanted to keep it so overall a poor experience 
-1,One of the most disgusting places i have ever been too in the world And i live in NYC In the early morning hours the place is full of herion addics doing drugs or just laying on their booths all high They put my coffee in the microwave when i asked for it to be hot Meaning it was probably from the night before I donot recommend this place unless you are a junkie 
-1,This one of the worst environments to eat and i aint too picky the place is nasty and filled with a whole lot of people with drug problems I felt a bit suspect when i walked in but still ordered the staff is rude and ignorant got my order wrong Bur i guess they go along with the crowd that comes in and treats everyone like that Be Warned not the best place and some Mcdonalds are ok 
-1,ROACH ROACH ROACH If I had the option to give no stars at all I would I simply walked in to use the bathroom and as I was waiting at the counter a roach came out of the bottom and was running around people 
-1,Why read a review of a McDonalds Because they re not all the same The quality of food and customer service changes across stores Slow Limited availability of basic soda Employees spent minutes watching an overflowing drinks machine instead of serving customers Worst McDonald s in the area 
-1,This McDonald s security is horrible The Africa American lady talks down to people and rush you while your still within your minute time limit She calls the police every minutes and her mouth is reckless towards paying customers I ve never been more horrified to go to McDonald s Me my friends eat there every day spending no less than a piece They just changed to this security company and they are very very nasty to paying cuatomers She flashes her police badge to scare people away from here This woman is very unprofessional and something needs to be done before someone gets hurt Thank you 
-1,DISGUSTING that s the only way I can describe this place It s am on a Saturday and my Lord not but people either sleeping in booths or begging for food or money and the bath room doors don t even lock Is this allowed to happen Is this how we run businesses in NY I guess McDonalds cares about ALL of their customers no matter how unsafe they feel They just want their money and can t get sued by someone less fortunate for being kicked out even if they haven t ordered anything Good job McD s 
-1,Two people got shot after an altercation at this McDonalds I walked past this morning and two low life thugs were bashing each other up with blood spilling over their faces Police had to restrain them The cheap low quality food produced here attracts a horrible crowd I wouldn t go here and I m looking forward to this establishment shutting down 
-1,Omg whatever compelled me to come in here aside from the fastest and courteous service ever it s frequented by the worst elements of society ever Police or security needed here cause these methadonians and crack addicts are over the top not to mention least harassing patrons for money
-1,I went in was a monday afternoon it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place I believe there s a Rehabilitation Center near by and that s the reason But however I DON T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE unless you order to take out 
-1,This is the worst Mcdonald s I have ever been in This place is the epitome of bad customer service They charge extra for additional ketchup do not offer free refills and a tiny portion of the dining room is open after am They close off most of the dining room One time I went in to order something around am but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything They were taking up space Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks but not this one One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive This is not an ideal place to dine in at all but it is still convenient to order a coffee there though 
-1,This place is horrible One of the employees allows drug addicts to use the restroom and hang out in the back I stopped here because my aunt wanted to use the restroom As soon as I took a look at the people hanging around it was obvious 
-1,Terrible location Workers are slow and ghetto Some don t even wear a uniform Random people come in and out the kitchen area an

-1,I would never go back there It was dirty and saw several drug deals while eating my food Never Again 
-1,I won t be visiting my local MacDonalds again after finding out about the awful conditions that their chickens endure They are bread to grow so large that they are crippled under their own weight and live a life of pain and suffering ImNotLovinIt

-1,I have just bought two BigMacs the first one contained no patties at all 
-1,Horrible It s cool that this McDonald s is a hr restaurant BUT it s almost midnight with only one other customer and here I am still waiting over minutes now How slow can they be I can see workers in here but that still don t explain this wait These workers sense of urgency is not there at all Not even moving with any purpose Maybe that is JUST the night So I hope 
-1,Manager was rude We asked simple questions about prices and deals and responded with no empathy 
-1,Waited in the dine in area for about mins for someone to take my order workers pass by me and saw me and didn t even acknowledge me Managers also pass by me and didn t even bother to ask if I was helped Restaurant has ordering machines but there not working so you have to wait for any of the many workers there to acknowledge your existence at the restaurant to make a purchase Will not be returning to this restaurant ever rather take my money else where 
-1,Why is show online lite a time open I pay many time then I came here it 
-1,It claims to be hours but when I stop by at and in the morning it s closed the cashier always tells me it s closed
-1,Customer service needs work at this location I came in during my lunch time to get a simple McChicken and fries and a drink Stood at the register for about to mins waiting for one of the many employees walking pass me to deliver the orders outside Once they finally notice me they took my order After I waited around another more mins to get my order I was gonna ask for BBQ sauce but decided I didn t wanna wait an extra mins for that Overall this restaurant only prioritize the drive thru and not the dine in area Dine in area has no cashier available because everyone is focus on drive thru So many workers on the front but none on cashier If your coming here for lunch hour order online or else your lunch hour might turn into only min lunch with all the waiting you ll be doing here 
-1,This one McDonald s I find charging for a large coffee everywhere else it is for any size drink and the reason I go to McDonald s at all is because of the coffee but if they re going to double the price of the coffee then I may as well go to any Eleven so I have to save this one particular McDonald s would not lower the price when I told him that it was everywhere else Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said I m going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think that s silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the coffee that is fairly good on a one to scale I would say McDonald s coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then there s creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than McDonald s one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think McDonald s at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers
-1,Pulled up at am Waited min in drive thru 
-1,Do not ever go to this McDonald s One of the most dysfunctional places I ve ever seen 
-1,apparently if you ask for cups of water here they will charge you for the nd cup 
-1, nd time ordering a filet o fish meal in this store and it just tastes so bland the fries were cold and hard Regret spending my money here 
-1,Lobby is always closed whan it s says is open hrs
-1,If I could I would give an absolute thumb s down to this embarrassing branch of a well loved fast food franchise NEVER will I return to it after being treated like a pariah I was yelled at by the cashier who took the wrong order and the branch manager threw a box of fries in the bag mumbling as if I was a beggar In her condescending tone the latter even warned me that she was doing me favor even though they made a mistake with my order and I did pay full price for it I think they both need more trainings to acquire the best of American customer service 
-1,Not good the drive thru they cannot manage who go first on the drive thru And they talking like a frog they cannot hear even you shout And when your to get the serve look around not doing his job properly
-1,Not hours Exposed Change your hours

-1,I have been living in this city for the last years I took the decision to make a quick stop and get something to eat wouuu food stars special the coffee perfect coffee but the customer service wouuu star is not enough the indian lady that I think is the manager terrible customer service and she was so rude with this customer that requeted and ketchup they really need to improve that 
-1,Given too many chances I ve tried to be polite no matter how rude the staff Tonight I gave more chance My order was taken down wrong so I confirmed at the second window before taking the food The woman was very upset she had to remake it made it clear with snatching and attitude told me to pull over and when i got my order it was wrong AGAIN Also took items and was charged for adding lettuce 
-1,Worse McDonald s I ve been to I have decided to go a mile further to the Augustine Dr one instead at this point Constantly slow missing items or not making them correctly Ordered for curbside at pm was told restaurant was closed and I need to contact corporate for a refund
-1,I already have low expectations given this is a McDonald s but the customer service at this location is amongst the worst I 
-1,Super sloooow The shake machine is always broken Early in the morning the service is almost impossible Takes forever just to take an order and takes forever to process the order Ordering ahead with the app saves no time And if you re lucky the coffee machine will be working You re better off going somewhere else I will never do business with this McDonalds again EVER 
-1,Night shift crew here is very iffy Guy in front of me gets served I get told the place is closed and then the guy behind gets served Honestly don t bother with this place Big waste of time 
-1,One of the worst service don 
-1,Terrible customer service Employees doesnt even smile or initiate the greeting Very long drive through up to minutes with just only lane open If I am a manager I will never tolerate this long wait time Drive through is suppose to be for the convenient and time saving but this service is just completely defeat the purpose
-1,I ordered several times from this store but recently last order I made the burger tasted like someone throw tobacco ash into it It tasted wired That 
-1,I don t like giving low reviews without eating somewhere but at midnight seeing the sign on the window saying open hours we pulled into the parking lot The lights were dimmed and the drive through was blocked with cones After leaving the freeway and going out of our way to stop here they were closed and the sign held a false advertisement Chances are we may not get the chance to visit when they are actually open so heed my warning THIS PLACE IS NOT HOURS Edit After visiting that night we tried again a little before midnight and the drive thru was still closed and blocked and the sign still said open hours 
-1,There is a horribly rude worker here I asked to order something and she just gave rude and sarcastic responses the entire time I confronted her about it at the window and she didn t seem to care Talked to the manager He said he would handle it Im sure he won t so I contacted corporate and gave my report Don t eat here They do not care about customer service 
-1,Slow service No Ice at Breakfast Coffee tasted like cleaning solution was not rinsed out Hilariously a McDonald s employee was walking around the corner with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on a plate to eat for their own breakfast Why no US flag 
-1,Shity customer service incompetent cashier took over mins to place a single man s dinner order it was only a big Mac fries and a drink Parking lot was full extremely small for the volume of customers Drive thru line was super long and extremely slow After I finally got to the window after I paid I had to wait there for mins just to be told to pull around and park Had to wait another mins to get my order 
-1,Not rated one star for this McDonald s they actually happen to be a solid and enthusiastic group of people always willing to ensure your happiness and satisfaction I just think McDonald s sucks in general That being said the staff at this specific restaurant is quite friendly and approachable and I ve never had a bad experience with the food or anything They re usually quick and the food tends to be accurately prepared In a world where this distinction mattered I d actually call this a really good McDonald s but the significant other is bummed about their removal of garlic fries and the ice cream machine is hellof broken all the time Anyway Bring vegan items to McDonald s 
-1,Food was cold and hamburger was not cooked all the way Ruined my lunch 
-1,I was there at am and was informed that i must wait until t for there for deal I went back thru the drive through more times once at and once at and was informed again that i had to wait until exactly Then when i finally got to order thwy also screwed me on a hash brown They werent polite about anything and made me feel very unwelcomed 
-1,I park into the parking lot I see vans full of homeless people s junk I walked in the MacDonald s bathroom one of the stalls was full of poop Later I got my food Was in my car ready to leave then I smelled poop on my hands The entrance door had poop from the person s hand But on the bright side they gave me an extra meal for free But the cleaning service was not good 
-1,The staff was rude and needs training on their people skills There was no good morning greeting and when asking about menu options it was like talking to a brick wall The service was also very slow even though it was not busy 
-1,They removed tellers add kiosk which slows down the service minutes to get a Mcflurry and two cookies Mcflurry is small is tiny cookies are as well Kitchen floor was dirty Kitchen crew was understaffed It won t be sad to see McDonald s decline I won t be going back to any of them Rarely ever do won t be hard to put a nail in the coffin 
-1,There is something about the drink here One time I ordered Ice Tea and it tasted weird I let go of that one time And yesterday I ordered the combo with Coke I ate and drank the next moment I had like an diarrhea like symptom The coke tasted weird too I never had a problem like this when I ordered from other Mcdonald Last time the Ice Tea tasted bad so I tossed it away I only took a sipped that s why I didn t get a diarrhea like symptoms But this time I was so thirsty so I consumed half of the drink 
-1,Placed our order through the drive thru Instead of getting a quarter pounder with my number meal I received plain mcgriddles We get home and order isn t right Tried to call and was unable to get through Not willing to go back out in the rain This has happened other times at this
-1,Horrible Manager here came for coffee and she started giving me and my family an attitude about rude she had blonde dyed hair and wore glasses older than years old disgrace

-1,Drive thru was blocked at pm Had to make a point turn to get out Not sure why block it when there are cars placed orders and waiting Location is a nightmare since under renovation Parking lot is taken by reno vehicles Nearby has awkward design 
-1,Very disappointed in McDonald s in today s world To me McDonald s has really gone downhill is service is the pits Any employees most of all can use a lot more training I know I used to be the head manager at East El Camino McDonald s and I m appalled of what it turn into I know when I was head manager there we always have a store I can just imagine what it is today 
-1,ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with cheese no pickles came in some aluminum bag all soggy nasty nsaty nsaty never again going there should have gotten stars
-1, people working learning how to work and two cleaning instead of helping the line of drive thru cars and people waiting inside to place their order Took a half hour to get two cheese burgers two fries and two drinks at at night And that was only half of what we ordered so we left 
-1,Went through the drive through and failed to check my order before getting on the road Twice before I have been given the wrong order How do they do that Third time s a charm I am pledging not to go to McD s again 
-1,Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with McD s to food alarms going off the whole time The manager was outside smoking leaving the staff to drown The girl behind the counter spent more time apologizing to the same people over and over rather then work Took about mins to get two dollar menu cheeseburgers Experience left a bad taste in my mouth Probably won t give a second chance even 
-1,I paid hotcakes and hash brown by drive through behind me couple cars lined up and I waited min to pick my food last time same order they missed hash brown so i was about to check the items but behind people waiting so I moved my car near by signal I checked hash brown missing again this time I want them to know so I turn and reach same drive through I explained one of the women staff came and ask my bag and she inspect I was not feel good at this point later she ask a male staff and discussing something and looking me like I m lying Bullshit who train the business ethics and code of cundect what the

-1,I go here a couple of times a day if they are on a roll of making good tasting unsweetened ice tea Ocassionally I get a snack They have on their menu pricing for pies each or for When I read pies I think it is all their pies Nope Their specialty pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and don t care Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read pies means only apple pie It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies If you leadership is so unhappy maybe they should go somewhere that is a happier place We all have choices There is some good leadership at this store and bad There is no in between Take your chances I mainly go there for the tea when it s good 
-1,Twice in months I thought I would get ice cream through the drive through Both times they had no ice cream or yogurt No sign stick in long drive through to pick up nothing not coming back again

-1,went there on new years eve around am crowded very much and the queue was not moving for the next minutes they did not had enough staff left with hunger stomach They should have atleast informed us that there is going to be a waiting time ppl before us and the queue never moved for minutes was surprising 
-1,Ordered a number chicken nugget meal for They somehow didn t get the fries part and only thought I ordered nuggets and drink wtf even though I had made it very clear that I ordered the meal Then they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL for the fries which would have put the total cost OVER the actual price of the meal I wasn t having any of that bullsh t and I guess they realized how ridiculous they were being because they relented pretty quickly and handed over the fries 
-1,It was great the view was from where i sat was the entrance door From where she sat was the soda machine In the middle was the order line We sat at a table that was designed for people in the order line waiting to order to look back some look straifht on and see you eating Why So they can get humgrier They already hungry Its probably because if your a kid eating a happy meal and they have toy there gonna want one too so you tell your parents you want one too Or I whatever there eating they want to eat too because they are too lazy to look at the menu Thats too much work So the put a table for people to view where are eating It menu ideas and advertisement 
-1,They had everyone wait in an extremely long line at the drive thru just to tell us it was cash only Which should absolutely not be a thing at a McDonalds We then had to continue waiting in line since there was no way out

-1,The truth is that I feel offended by the Mananger he yelled at me as if I were his employee I really don t understand I just asked him a question about an order that is already prepared and ready and he doesn t deliver it to me because he doesn t feel like it I work as a delivery person for DoorDash It s ridiculous to have to stand in line at the drive thru to get something that s already done really star I work every night at that site and I have never had a problem with any of the cographers everyone is friendly and professional
-1,Ordered a few McDoubles and a pc nugget kids meal Asked for extra fries for the kids meal but was denied the request Beef Patties were old on the McDoubles nuggets were old and cold but there were plenty of customers so I don 
-1,Worst McDonald s experience to date Attempted to use drive thru code at time of order and was refused Placed our order that would include the discount when code was applied Pulled up to the window to a frumpy red headed clown of an employee that promptly slammed the card reader through my window with nigh a word I asked to have our discount code applied and he begrudgingly got his scanner out to read the QR code but he had wrung the order up incorrectly so the discount was not applying He requested assistance from his manager and their solution was to add a second premium drink to the order at an up charge All staff came across dower and melancholy Even when I commented that I was concerned about the accuracy and that this had been a terrible experience I was ignored I don t know if they beat their employees on a regular basis to keep s ll ever go back to this location again 
-1,Bathrooms were absolutely disgusting tampons on the ground before you walk into the building just really dirty
-1,Can not even order food they were not even incompetent enough to make an order

-1,DO NOT GO TO THIS MCDONALD S UNLESS YOU SPEAK SPANISH Every Sunday I go get breakfast for my brother Every time I order the same thing burritos SMALL COFFEE WITH SUGARS They have not got the order right YET Why cause everyone that works there is a Mexican that can t speak or read English I took back the coffee again cause the sticker receipt Sugar I got coffee with Creamer BECAUSE THEY CAN T READ ENGLISH 
-1,Lobby ordering is only open M F am pm Without a car for drive up window or App you are out of luck I 
-1,I didn t get a chance to try it Went to pick up some McDonald s from this hour location at a m but no one would respond at the drive thru speaker When I drove up to the window the two gentlemen inside acted like they couldn t see me I honked and waved my arms and it was clear that they could see me but they would not acknowledge my presence Totally unacceptable and unprofessional If you re under staffed or closed put a sign on the door or at the drive thru 
-1,If you order at the desk you feel like they re bothered They don t display any type of customer service at all When I get a mcflurry they don t mix it or even fill it anywhere near the top Steer clear 
-1,This has to be the worst McDonalds The food is never hot and never fresh I went there again tonight since it s the only place open The fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours This places stays pretty busy so there is no excuse for poor quality of food imo Avoid unless it s your only option 
-1,Next time I ll just tell them to suprises me they never get my order right anyway

-1,Cold food usually and missing orders constantly Any other McDonald 
-1,Wow For starters the place was trashed Litteraly every single table was dirty and the floor need to be swept badly Had to go up and ask for lids because they had not stocked anything in the lobby I willing to give places like this a second chance if I see effert But I saw none from the staff It was not remotely busy and staff still did virtually nothing to improve the cleanliness of the lobby Needless to say I will not be returning 
-1,The absolute worst location The people are rude and order has been wrong the last x I 
-1,Worst experience ever First the cashier gave me attitude about using the app for the large fries he sighed when I showed it to him Then said in a rude tone that I need to show him the bar code in the past I just show them the number and they type it in Then literally rolled his eyes when I told him it was Apple Pay and said whatever Then stared at me after taking the Apple Pay so I figured I would get the receipt at the next window I pulled up to the next window and they told me the other guy has thrown the receipt away Got home looked to see how much I was charged and he did not apply the app discount to the fries My fries that I had ordered well done both large and medium were cold and soft I live a block away the nuggets were old and the cheeseburger bun was not soft I was there today a Sunday at pm dinner time things shor charged for cold not fresh food
-1,Well earlier today I placed separate orders but when I arrived there doors were locked there was no letter or any sort of notice explaining why but what confuses me more is they had people inside ordering and sitting down inside not happy with that location 
-1,OK I guess I need to stop going to ANY Mcdonalds Was in a hurry and ordered a double cheese and a small order of fries They have two pickup windows and I watched both windows handing out food So when the line moved up I drove to the furthest window and sat and sat and watched other cars pick up their food at the window behind me a good minutes passed and I backed up to the window where the food was being handed out and the person basically THREW the food at me without a word steps steps to bring me my food or something but nothing And then the fries were cold and the bun on the burger was stale You get what you pay for and you get what you deserve if you go to a Salt Lake McDonalds 
-1,I ordered on mobile Came to the McDonalds to pick up minutes in the drive through By the time I got my food it was all cold Wasted my money They told me the wait was so l
-1,This restaurant is advertised as hours I waited over minutes in the drive through with at least other cars only to have no response from the speaker Then they shut the lights off and still no communication Staff was seen inside working but no attempt was made to tell waiting customers that they were refusing to serve them 
-1,Only the drive through is open hrs Walk in only open until pm
-1,Was missing the hash browns from my meals which made my hr drive back to Canada v v sad 
-1,Employees were slovenly One employee had her boyfriend behind the counter whispering in her ear instead of taking our order Took minutes to get a diet coke
-1,Went to this location and went through and the first thing that happened is someone started moaning in the mic Then we ordered large fries and small fry and they tried to say we ordered large drinks and a small fry it was ridiculous They were to busy making inappropriate sounds instead of doing their job If I could give less then one star I would Will NOT ever come here again 
-1,I wanted these guys to be better than the other locations nearby but they are all the same Open your lobby It s pm car lines waiting for AT LEAST minutes is horrible All McDonal
-1,Do not order from here there was a hair in my soda 
-1,Does not attend to the needs of a driver delivering food as they make you wait through the drivethru when the order is ready sitting on the counter while you re Cars back Food is getting cold and they expect you to wait and then deliver this cold food to the customer when you finally get it What a lousy way of attending drivers new employees or new management is much needed for this joke of a restaurant 
-1,This location is a joke There s a whole line all The way out in the street and we have all b
-1,So there is no way to get food from this McDonald s unless you are driving in a vehicle You have an entire lobby that could be fulfilling the orders of patrons without vehicles or staying in your nearby hotels
-1,I went to walk in the lobby and the doors were locked minutes before closing time Horrible customer service 
-1,This restaurant has to learn how to treat delivery driver professionally and properly I went picking up an order and wait in the drive through for minutes and it ended with them telling me they couldn t make the order because they turned off the screen The only reason they couldn t fulfill the order is because of their laziness because I have seen other McDona
-1,Working a graveyard shift in the area I thought of grabbing a quick bite while on a quick break Pulling into the drive thru after vehicles in front have ordered female worker mumbled something about their system updating and asked to wait As I waited for a few moments she then rudely told me that it was still updating and couldn t take my order even though she took an order ahead of me I asked how long it would take but no answer was given I asked again she continued to say it was updating and that she couldn t take my order I finally started putting in a mobile order to make it easier on their end but she got back on again and rudely said ho while their system updated So I decided to leave to find another place to grab a quick bite only to hear her say that she did mention they were closed if I were listening to her Another driver in the other stall was having the same issue with another male employee but was actually nice enough to let them know they were temporarily closed until further notice Clear unprofessional attitude from this female employee Definitely needs to be taught better in respect and in having better customer service skills Guess when you get paid minimum wage I d be miserable too Bu

-1,I wanted to order but they didn t have a curbside option and they weren t open for dining in A bunch of people tries going through the drive thru but because we didn t have cars they wouldn t even talk to us There were a lot of other customers too 
-1,Posting this review in hopes that someone sees it My number one complaint is the hours listed it says hrs but that is not true I m not sure when they actually close but I ve been there at midnight way later around am and am and they re closed The funny thing is that there s usually someone inside to tell me that they re closed I don t mind that they close early but they need to correct their hours if that s the case I frequently get off work rather late and I m usually pretty hungry I can go somewhere else but this location would be convenient for me for how close it is to my work It s also frustrating that they allow me to pay on the app and then not get my food Please adjust your hours online and on the app so people like me don t get their hopes up 
-1,Drive through Asked by manager to pull to the side and wait minutes for apple pies to finish cooking No problem Received of my order after those minutes Both sandwiches handed to me cold Said he forgot of my drinks and he d brb MINUTES LATER AND NO ONE IS ANYWHERE I circle through drive through again and ask to speak to the first guy I just want my drink and the missing sauces He s MIA The gentleman who help
-1,I want the word to go out about James at this location He is the worst manager ever And to the Watson group that owns this location I m going to make sure that I spread the word not to visit this location because of James We waited over minutes because you had only one drive thru open and things were going slow Well the clock just turned to and we wanted breakfast They told us no Even though we were in line long before then and it is not our fault that everything was going slow I called James and I was upset I didn t swear but instead of him understanding how this would be frustrating he just kept giving excuse after excuse and then whined that he wasn t going to talk anymore and hung up on me Like I said I didn t swear but I let him know that it was rude how they treat people IF I CAN GIVE ZERO BECAUSE OF JAMES I WOULD Learn to understand your customers Until then everyone stay away from here 
-1,Trash was overflowing Coke dispenser was out of syrup and worst of all my hamburger was raw Not a good experience 
-1,Hit or miss with this on On some occasions the service is good but mostly bad One Saturday morning myself and another car pulled up to the drive thru and waited for almost minutes I pulled forward and went inside got my order and as I was leaving saw the other car just pulling up to the pick up window Food is typically warm not hot sat at the drive in while they took cars from the other lane after telling me they would be right with me Left without ordering most likely won t 
-1,Would leave zero stars but I can t The food is nasty Re dropped fries and burgers that have been in the heater all day Only good thing is the lobby stays clean with
-1,Drive through staff will short you dollars worth of food almost every time Very slow service 
-1,Really bad experience We went through the drive through at night and ordered two chocolate shakes We paid Got to the pickup window and the lady told us they didn t have chocolate shakes and asked us if we wanted vanilla or our money back We told her we wanted our money 
-1,I was on my pedal bike in drive thru as I have done a countless other locations A lady come on the speaker and told me the wait time was going to be minutes It was late I just got off work and was hungry so I didn t mind I wanted some McDonald s I placed my order and then she told me they do not accept walk ups I told her I am on a bicycle not a walk up She told me she was cancelling my order Needless to say no McDonald s that night and now the company has lost my business 
-1,Me and My Wife went to get ice coffees this morning I asked for extra syrup and cream and what we got was no extra syrup no extra cream and they charged us for the extra cream and syrup that was never put in the coffee The coffee would ve tasted better if we didn 
-1,The Hispanic females there were putting hair in people s food
-1,I walked there Would not let me order at the window I don t see a problem taking an order if you aren t in a vehicle You get the money before you make the order And the lady was very rude to me she slammed the window on me and wouldn t even say for example our policy doesn t allow us to serve unless you re in a vehicle sorry or something of that sort s hi e was very poorly trained Remember you do serve the public a n d McDonald s isn t my favorite It was convinient It is unhealthy for you Probably live longer because I never got their food I ll never go there again 
-1,Dining room was closed with no sign indicating it was Called to inquire why it was and female employee was incredibly rude When I asked why the dining room was closed she gave me a lot of attitude and said Uh because it is Because we don t have enough people As if that should have been obvious again there was no sign That woman needs to learn how to speak to people with respect 
-1,Go to another nearby location and you ll get better service All the employees are nice except for one The trans woman who works nights is ALWAYS SO RUDE she s the reason I don t go to this location anymore She goes out of her way to make it so you can t use coupons from the app as well For example the buy one get one free for quarter pounder big mac etc It can only be used when the sandwiches are rung in not in a meal she knows this and purposely puts in a meal so that your coupon won t work and when you ask to have it removed from the meal she says no so you have to pay double Always an attitude Go to another location nearby 
-1,I am most certainly not lovin it 
-1,They didn t have fries or ice cream Let s be honest though we already knew the second one 
-1,Horrible customer service They ignore their customers when clearly standing in line 
-1,Ordered a Chocolate Shake and they gave me a mixture of chocolate and mint I drove back and asked them to fix it They made me wait minute and gave me a mixture of mainly vanilla ice cream When I asked they told me thay the machine was not working right What a ripoff 
-1,I can t remember the time I got good fries from them Once in a while there are good employees there that make up for it but I have simply dropped this place from my list of places to go after the last few times I ve eaten there I should say this is for all McDonald s
-1,High prices terrible food stale and customer service lacking Tried a few times to give them a chance but I 
-1,Literally had two homeless people come to my car while ordering One of them tried to open my door on the passenger side The other one reached inside I am a grown man This spooked me Never again will I go to this location 
-1,So my boyfriend and I ordered a large fries and large drinks We get to the window to pay l Had a coupon on the app for the large fries Then I was paying for the rest on venmo The girl at the register had no idea what she was doing She had the assistant manager come help her she had no idea what she was doing Then the manager came and we had now told them over times to just take off the drinks The manager still had a hard time How hard is it to take drinks off an order He then was trying to say we had to pay for the fries He eventually just let us have the fries for free We also had a second order with another large fries we had phone s with Free fries They were all rude and didn t care about us at all stars
-1,Worst McDonald s on this planet Don t order to go the drive through is faster The
-1,We were visiting From out of town and came through the drive through for some breakfast The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was so hard it must have been under the warming light for hours It was impossible to eat My sausage mcmuffin was so dry not at all what I am used to and I order these regularly After getting to our hotel room less than minutes from there and finding out how terrible our breakfast was we called to let the manager know Not only did she insinuate that we were lying but was less than professional by far I have not complained to a fast food establishment for over years So when I feel food is this substandard and take time out to call I would have expected some common courtesy not an ignorant attitude especially from management Needless to say when I come back this way I will not be eating at this location If I were you I wouldn t either 
-1,Worst customer experience I ve ever had Period Night manager read our order back to us extremely quick thinking she made a mistake I repeated it back to her She cut me off and told me that I was being rude and to get out of her line and that she wouldn t give us our food She continued to tell us how her night would be better once we left her line and how we had made her night so bad I told I just wanted to make sure she got the order right said she didn t care and told me to get out of line Craziest thing I 
-1,Went to eat there tonight and no one was there It says that you guys are open hours drive thru only but no one was there at the kiosk or at the windows So please update your business hours 
-1,Man This Location Sucks So Bad 
-1,Honestly idk who runs this place But the turnaround time is patheticcccc Like I get is McDonald s The expectations are low But this place routinely has the longest wait time I 
-1,Since I work graveyards I unfortunately have to rely on McDonald s for food sometimes I recently started trying to come here since the th east location is no longer open hours Every time they ve been closed for cleaning If you re going to close update your hours so I don t waste my time driving all the way to you only to have to drive all the way to south Maybe you should stop paying starvation wages and you d be able to hire an extra hand to help clean lol 
-1,Order mcdoubles and chicken nuggets and fries for my kids Burgers were dry like they had been under heat or light for too long I mean sand dry Fries were stale not freshly prepared Was beyond disappointed you work hard to make money twenty something dollars wasted on bad quality food beyond disappointed is an understatement I won t be coming back to this location 
-1,Watch out for the homeless people in the drive through Shirtless guy will walk right up to your window and tell you to go F yourself if you don t buy him food 
-1,I love nothing more than McDonalds fries It s hard to imagine that anyone comes to McDonald s
-1,Tried to order before hitting the airport they asked us to wait a few minutes We left after without hearing another word 
-1,They charged me for a medium drink for my nieces happy meal didn t ask for a medium drink The guy who handed me my food barely acknowledged we were there at the window He practically threw our food in our window while not even looking Almost dropped our drinks He was just shoving our food and drinks out his window blindly I asked him why we had a medium drink he said he didn t know because it was all automatic The cashier didn t give us our receipt so I asked him if I could get a copy of my receipt He stormed off and comes back about a minute later shoves the receipt in my face and tells me if I want a copy of my receipt I need to ask at the first window I just wanted to know about the medium drink otherwise I wouldn t have needed a copy of my receipt or if the cashier would have given me one I wouldn t have had to ask Worst McDonald s I have ever been to Never making that mistake again 
-1,Service was quick but the person taking my order was completely unprofessional and not accommodating at all Horrible service When asked for my drink I stated half coke the lady cut me off and aggressively said 
-1,After a few unsuccessful visits I have the impression you ll be served if the staff happen to feel like it 
-1,I was staying next door at the hotel and decided to stop in for breakfast sandwich and the sandwich was nasty wasn t cooked But my reason for the one star is the way the manager spoke to her worker in front of customers this was on I was like WOW really Talk to people the way you would want to be spoken to If you want to be rude talk to the person in the back But otherwise learn to be a better manager that was unacceptable 
-1,I m sorry But half the people working here dont have a clue whats going on of the time I come here they forget something Its unbelievable No other fast food chain has as many issues as any McDonald s does Blows my mind And these people want raises Learn how to do your job if you want a raise 
-1,This McDonalds is a joke What they fail to mention on their hours of operation is at Midnight is that they are not able to take any Orders because their system is updating for at least min Never heard of any other McDonalds closing down just to update It would be nice if they stated that on google so people don t waste their time and gas for nothing 
-1,This has GOT to be the worst McDonald s in America I live next 
-1,We went on Friday night around and it was slow We waited in like for minutes then waited for our order and even to get to the window for thirty minutes The people on the window and intercom were beyond rude like i understand you re busy but you DO NOT need to be rude to your customers reguardless how busy you are 
-1,This place is slloowwwwww
-1,They forget everything and charge you for it
-1,Called to confirm I could order using the app and walk up to pick up my order as I am staying at a hotel nearby Other McDonalds just bring it to you outside the door when the lobby is closed They just hung up on me and kept the phone off the hook Wow now that s customer service they won
-1,They mixed up my order in the drive thru with someone else s and gave me the wrong food I guess that s what I get for not checking my bag until I drove minutes home and for eating at McDonald s in the first place 
-1,Do not go here My family came here on Christmas Eve and had the worst experience We stayed at a hotel and wanted some nice hot chocolate and cookies and the cookies were hard as a rock and the hot chocolate was disgusting It was hot water with peppermint On top of it the customer service was awful They refuse to take your order and make you do it on their machines If u have questions too bad We went back three times and they still got it wrong Just save your time and do not go here 
-1,PLAN TO BE UNWELCOMED Mar p m I expect to be treated with basic common courtesy nothing more and especially nothing less I have had customer service issues with this McD s franchise before and have taken issues to the managers Tonight I became livid I parked my rented scooter along the side of the building like I ve done for the last year with no problem Tonight a large black security guard got out of his car and yelled across the lot that I couldn reep moving on he had gone inside by this time It was not the words though gruffly spat but his tone and his pompous condescending attitude towards me I continued to the front parked the scooter AGAIN and went straight to the manager to vent my complaint about the treatment I had received Initially the complaint was well and openly received by a young demur manager on duty and she apologized for the treatment I also explained that I lived in the area frequented this McD s and that I would rather inconvenience myself and go an additional mile and a half to Burger King than spend one dime at this McD ive change in their employees or the District Corporate Big Wigs are allowing this to happen The lack of customer service and concern is appalling especially for a name like McDonalds I stormed out and left in disgust Advice Don t expect to be treated like a valued customer 
-1,Was craving a breakfast sandwich but they stopped selling those all day Then I shifted to a chicken sandwich but they only sell the spicy version now Sadly I drove away with no food 
-1,I ordered big macs They had no meat No patties Seriously 
-1,This place is very dirty the employees are very rude They got mad cause we asked for ketchup Then we stayed in to eat and the employees are talking and putting down all the customers They have been putting the men and lady s in the same bathroom cause the men s is closed and then my daughter went to use the bathroom the lady up front said there is men in there cause there is closed So she went in then the security guard need to use it and then the employees where talking about my daughter I went up there and told them that If they would take better Care and clean your place it would be up Plus you have food over every where they don t wash there hands they don t clean the tables then you ask for a wash cloth to clean they say we don t have any clean There is so many drug dealers here even the workers are sale I ng inside in the lobby in the parking lot I will never come here again I m also calling the cops on the drug deals I seen Even with a security guard on duty he just looks the other way DO NOT EVER COME HERE
-1,Yo real talk this mcdonalds convinced me to never give mcdonalds another dollar for the rest of my life Last place in all categories WOW
-1,Ordered a bacon egg and cheese biscuit meal and they give me no bacon They did send me complimentary meals which was great I go back with the free coupon and they gave me a chicken sandwich when I ordered a signature burger Called their office to let them know and they did not care Now I call Corporate in Chicago how do you like me now 
-1,The worst drive thru service I ve ever had anywhere From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was mins At least mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long I d been there So roughly an hour to get my food Then only to be treated rudely by the cashier because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only Not sure why since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time I ll never go there again I ll drive a few mins to another location 
-1,I don t go to McDonald s often but I ve been here twice in the last year both times were terrible I went through the drive through both times One time during the lunch hour I didn t get one of my burgers I got the rest of a meal but the quarter pounder never made it in the bag I didn t know until I got home Tonight I waited minutes no exaggeration to get burger from the line I will never go here again I should have just driven home to eat It would have been faster 
-1,this place sucks two of the employees were yelling at each other super immaturely the store was disgusting it took forever to order and even longer to get our food like I said the management sucked the employee he was arguing with just quit on the spot saying I m outta here and just left after being asked to do his job entertainment value is five stars quality is one star 
-1, Zero stars if offered Employees and superiors lack customer satisfaction service Because employees follow lead of supervisors can do attitudes are can t and won t In regards of coffee and soft drinks we were told it is their policy to not offer refills due to high levels of homeless What an awful thing to say The restrooms are locked To exit restrooms one must know we did not to press a button in order for the door to unlock Definitely not the McDonald s for us We would not be surprised if higher management reads this review then ultimately bar us from their establishment even though we shall not return to this McDonald s location 
-1,So incredibly slow once the bars closed and the drunks got hungry Fries were old not hot Disorder with the drive through lanes cars in the outside lane back to back to back ordered if those cars should have been behind my order while our car knowing what we were ordering given we had at least minutes waiting in line just to get to the ordering board microphone speaker sat at the menu for over minutes waiting to order Overall our drive through wait time was forty YES minutes Will NOT go there again Also the frequent harassment made by the half dozen homeless people begging for either money cigarettes food or to wash our Windows Clearly they should have picked up on our lack of patience at that point and left us the Alone McDonalds staff or management should fix that problem for others as well 
-1,I am highly enraged with their service They didn t specify on their signs in the parking lot that I couldn t leave the parking lot for more than five minutes They booted my truck and I had to pay him with my food in hand I ve tried talking to the store manager McDonald s main office and submitted a complaint All I get it s the run around hung up on and berated I m not much for posting these kinds of things but I m out money I feel wasn t owed and feel highly taken advantage of 
-1,There was blood on the womens bathroom toilet I told the old cashier and she said o well I tried talking the manager and she completely ignored me I tried calling the number on my receipt different times and everytime I got a busy signal My daughter and I were standing off to the side waiting for our drinks and thank god after seeing the kitchen area we did not order food I was completely and utterly disgusting Please do not go to this McDonalds I rated it star only because I had to rate it to leave this to bad 
-1,Zero customer service skills They don t even acknowledge yor presence You talk to them and besides taking your order and your money they don t even thank you for shopping there 
-1,I don t like cold fries No one does When a sign says Customer Parking only does that exclude customers minutes into the future I have waited longer than that in this location s drive through I had a combo stop to make Pick up some rum and bring home some dinner for me and the wife I parked at McDonald s and walked the seconds or so to the liquor store A purchase and the return voyage took all of five minutes By the time I had returned there was a boot on my car The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonald s customer I would have had to make my fast food purchase first and then been given minutes in the parking lot It s a cold November evening Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned so I did things in what seemed like the logical order later I was too disgusted to eat I went into the store to file a complaint but was bullied out by the towing staff This isn t a predatory company per se but they re in bed with one 
-1,Literally the worstMcD s in the world Going through drive thru she gave us our drinks and told us to pull forward by door then blocking the person behind us from getting out We took initiative and parked in th he drive thru spot Husband then went in to find out what was happening defeating the point of drive thru He said the staff were abysmally slow taking forever to put each item in the bag We were starving but only ate a little I ve never had McDonald s where grease runs down your arms and the fries were revoltingly greasy too Surprisingly none of us got food poisoning 
-1,I was driving through the area with a friend and had to settle for this McDonald s after an hour and a half search for an open location that would serve me However I found out this location also did not have a working ice cream machine How can all the machines be down in a city at once This is some terrible service My drive thru order taker was rude and had no idea how to process a cash payment The driving lanes are also an apparent problem for the usual people coming here at night as two vehicles swerved into me and attempted to go in front of me in order to exit while I was at the ordering spot 
-1,Poor slow service an older man came to my table showed me words on his phone saying I had minutes to finish my food and leave I asked the cashier about the Man and he claimed he is security and that even though I had paid for my items I could only be there minutes I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was not one on duty that day I then asked for corporate office phone number and was told they don t have it Very rude way to treat anyone at all 
-1,The food at this place is always cold and old There s always someone that doesn t know what they 
-1,The bathroom was disgusting Someone had left a mess in one of the stalls and bloody tissues by the sink biohazard I let someone know to come clean it but she just came in looked at it and left I was in a hurry with three children so we had to cycle through using one stall and there was a constant line forming behind us If my kids didn t have to go so badly we would have gone somewhere else I would never stop there again 
-1,If I could I would give them stars Currently McDonalds is doing a buy one get one for a dollar piece McNuggets quarter pounder with cheese and a Big Mac Instead of just charging me what a normal piece and then add a for a second one they made me pay more for a 
-1,Could you update the lobby hours It seems to change every two weeks With the pandemic going on the least you can do is not waste anyone s time 
-1,Dining room closes at pm 
-1,Staff was unfriendly and food tasted old The fried onions on my signature hamburger tasted burnt We had just got out of a concert and they were busy but our fries tasted like they had been sitting around for minutes It was gross
-1,Horrible service the drive through associates just ask you what else they can get for you I literally told them that s all times and could hear other employees laughing 
-1,Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru One patty wasn t even cooked The buns were burnt black instead of toasted Fries came out cold My wife ordered a Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce Didn t get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well HORRIBLE SERVICE 
-1,The employees at this location threaten my sister in law because she asked for a happy meal she ordered but didn t get The manager needs to hire people who don t threaten their customers 
-1,Seriously this is the absolute worst service I ve ever had The manager is lazy and we sat in the drive thru for damn minutes We pulled up to the first window and he opens the window and sits there talking and completely ignored us Then we pay and pull up to the nd window and literally employees are sitting there talking We re at minutes and counting and still sitting at the nd window All for hash browns and a sandwhich 
-1,The drive through is open during construction but the it took almost minutes of waiting at the window then the manager handed me the food and drink while loudly arguing with a co worker about how they don t like working together No apology for the long wait Won t go back to that location again 
-1,Very rude Will not come again I 
-1,We came to eat McDonalds to have a lovely meal as friends in the evening of June rd We were informed that we were not allowed to order chicken nuggets because it was breakfast time When we got back to our place we were extremely disappointed to find our large fries container was half full cold and had no salt whatsoever My sausage egg biscuit was missing the
-1,At first glance the place looks good but the first quarter pounder was cold and when I watched them fix the second I found the the commercial about being cooked fresh is bs They pulled the meat from a drawer and it was barely warmer than the first Then the flies inside were all over everything Yuk the last time I will come here Right before I left a guy came in and tried to get some water and a rude sweaty security guard was stopping him Wow this place is not where I would take family 
-1,Fifteen minute wait in the drive through They don t pull cars aside with larger orders to keep the line moving Predatory booting person roaming the lot You ll probably be more comfortable with police supervising the exchange if you happen to get booted 
-1,So in the morning obviously means something else to this McDonald s No coffee made up The jerk at the window couldn t have been more rude and put off that we were there Today we were up early to start our long drive home after what was a very nice weekend in Salt Lake City If this is the impression McDonald s wants to leave the I am happy to never frequent any of their establishments minutes from the time we paid til the we got our food in the drive through and two cars behind us got theirs ahead of us All we ordered were two cokes and two sausage biscuits 
-1,Spent over minutes in line to be told that only serve breakfast at am even though their menu said lunch also Then told they were out of almost everything Don t waste your time going here at night I ve gone two separate times and had seriously awful experiences Don t go here there s a Denny s near by and several gas stations with better service and better food 
-1,I understand you re under construction but your employees are ridiculous The employee that shuttles the money was one his cell phone the entire time I gave him a and told him I had the correct change but he just walked off still on his phone Also if I order and pay for a medium fry I don t want a small amount in a medium container just thrown in the bag 
-1,Horrible experience Waited for over mins in the drive thru to have them forget part of our order Not to mention they couldn t figure out 
-1,This McDs SUCKS Their food is disgusting and their service sucks They forgot my kids entire happy meal and when they brought it out there was no toy and no chicken nuggets We ordered sundaes to go and they delivered it to a random table and took some other guys marker And to top it all off they were RUDE like it was my fault they suck at their job This is the absolute WORST experience I ve ever had at a restaurant ever 
-1,We were going to the Children s museum my granddaughter wanted McDonald Apparently at this location they will only take your order in the drive thru We had to call over the counter for help We were told that we had to order from the kiosk I explained to them that I had cash They told me that I still needed to order from the kiosk then pay cash at the counter what then why won t they just take my order Then we had to call over the counter a nd time because we were struggling with the kiosk The lady that came out said I had to order my meal a la carte what Needless to say we walked out will NEVER return If it s such an inconvenience to take people s orders inside maybe they should close the lobby at this location only have the drive thru From the way people were treated while I was there reading other reviews apparently the customers inside real do NOT matter I m surprised that McDonald s would allow a location franchise to treat customers this way 
-1,I went to order Sweet and Spicy glazed tenders I said it numerous times and the drive through kept asking what sauce I wanted Should be obvious Sweet and Spicy glaze I left there and went to McDonald s on S Redwood Road Much better service and food is what I ordered 
-1,This Store is the highest priced store probably the most unfriendly and unprofessional in Utah The heavy set Hispanic lady at the counter had just taken an order from the young man a head of me and would not take my order She was going to make me do my order on the kiosk When I told here no that I would go somewhere else before I would do that she told me goodbye Yes I am done with mcdonalds You are not getting another dime of my hard earned money ever if you continue these business tactics I will be happy to hear you are in bankruptcy Enjoy the time you have left Just a side note I have been going to this mcdonalds for over years at least one day per week Never again Good thing Wendy s right around the corner was more than happy to take my order and my money Funny part is Wendy s double burger had more meat and tasted better and the price was almost a dollar cheaper 
-1,I bought two coffees for my twin and I planned to buy some food tried to use the bathroom first it wasn t available for minutes so I left without purchasing anything else That s a zero rating but I need to post 
-1,Went inside to get service faster oh was I wrong Waiting for more than an hour to be served paid at the touchscreen got cups to serve drinks and soda was terrible other people left and requested a refund people got fired this same night Elderly people were still waiting to get some food and told me about their bad experience they seem to be patient but dang this has to be the worst experience in a McDonald s ever We are Never coming back 
-1,First My Hamburger Was Ugly It Had The Ketchup All Over The Place Next My Fries Were Super Salty And Some Way To Crispy And Lastly My Shake Tasted Horrible You Could Taste All The Syrup And There Was No Cherry The Only Good Thing About My Trip Was Their Playground 
-1,What a joke I went to this McDonald s I work at Gateway got some chicken nuggets asked for an extra sweet and sour sauce on top of the two that they usually give you was very nice to the lady didn t say you re welcome when I said thank you and did not put my sauce in the bag no I don 
-1,Sat waiting for several minutes before asking for help several times i said typical bs and backed up to enter other lane when i heard a man laughing from the mic and saying hello 
-1,Horrible Bad customer service awful food cold hot and spicys were burnt fries were half empty cold and just tasted like oil just a bad experience overall Location on east and south is definitely worth the extra few minute 
-1,I feel that it is OK to charge to use the restrooms Yet they are so gross it s not worth it Employees sneezing on Apple pies whipping hands on seat of pants The new management is not any better They where dumb to buy this one If you have enough room to install two toilets then install two toilets don t be ghetto and only have only one 
-1,Do not park in their lot even if you are eating there The parking enforcement put a boot on my car after I ate here and refused to take it off unless I paid I told him I just ate here and he told me the ATM was inside seriously Not to mention that the lobby was littered with food waste staff was rude they didn t have ice cream or shakes and bathrooms were dirty stars if I could 
-1,We were waiting in the drive thru on a Sunday morning We were asked for our order only AFTER WE had said something about asking if our order was going to be taken and after having other cars in the drive thru next to us had gone We started ordering and then the employee on the intercom said mid order hold on I m helping a customer Um isn t that what you re supposed to be doing with us I said screw it and drove off You re in the customer service industry I suggest learning some 
-1, am Wait minutes behind the car in front of me am Sever Cash only our system is down and rebooting Me that s fine Sever ok what can we get for you Me number one medium with lemonade please Sever hold on one moment Me ok Sever Me Me hello Silence Silence That s when I left One car was at the window and at least in line to order It s always something here No coffee at am Out of fries Cash only minute wait with nothing to show for it Super frustrating If you are down to test your patience give this location a shot 
-1,This particular store you never know when their lobby is open Quick service but they never abide by their posted hours
-1,I pull up to drive thru and told to wait a moment I wait minutes to place order still nobody takes my order I pull up to window thinking maybe I was forgotten I honking horn employees looks at me and walks away I stay there for another minutes waiting and still nobody takes my order And all the while I watch at least other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders If your not going to do your job as an employee of McDonald s let the customers know so they don t have to wait for nothing By the way I had to give one star to post this Other wise they would get stars 
-1,Customer service is horrible Customer isn t right here There correct and your wrong when they screw up an order
-1,Just ordered BigMacs one with no lettuce Had NO sauce the other had a teaspoon worth on the edge of the burger Fries were meh 
-1,This has got to be hands down one of the worst McDonald s restaurants around Their service is downright abysmal Also they are extremely high priced I do have to say that their food does live up to McDonald s standards But by the time you fight off the homeless people deal with the bad customer service and pay exorbitant prices this location just isn t worth it One other thing of note This location does not honor the surveys for the buy one get one free 
-1,I have never encountered a restaurant so rude before We arrived there at they close at I know it s tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close but we were hours away from home and hungry Not only were the doors already locked but the three employees plus a security guard would not come to the door or even acknowledge we were there Locking the doors early when your signs state your hours is unexceptable 
-1,Had my car booted by of the dumbest people I have ever met while my girl friend was buying a soda and I was buying wine for a lovely night There are total signs displaying this premise but are on the opposite side of the lot and one is not reflective for their night shift of booting towing The signs also say people who aren t patrons will be booted which I by extension was My night was spent arguing with the employees and the tow company instead I recommend a wholehearted boycott 
-1,This place always has the door lock so you can not get in to the restaurant
-1,Extremely rude lady in the morning I spoke to her with a smile and that did not deter her from the destain she showed from what I assume because she had to serve me Waaay too many other McDonald s around for me to need to deal with that in the morning If you see a short Asian lady with a grey uniform shirt do not bother she will just make your morning worse 
-1,Would give zero starts if I would they all have an ugly attitude as if I was responsible for them working there I asked for a caramel macchiato and they said the machine wasn t working Then the person behind me or
-1,I would like to preface with the statement that I am a fairly hardcore proponent of the proletariat With that said the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk Secondly there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol Fortunately the security guard is calm and collected I mean generally if youre on the clock where else do you have to be Service is inconsistent per the usual horrible with Uber eats drivers and seem intent on the self destructive goal of sabotage my job 
-1,Been waiting in a long line for the past minutes Pull up to the window to pay and the employee with the long blue fake nails is messing around on their phone watching YouTube No wonder it was taking forever 
-1,The place is disgusting in terms of cleanliness Full of homeless people on heroin We actually threw the food in the garbage after we paid for it It looked nasty and dangerously filthy Parking lot outside is full of shady people checking out what is in your car When we were leaving we saw about people laying on the sidewalks totally stoned from some drug Wouldn t recommend at all 
-1,Terrible experience with this McDonald s Employees don t care about nothing dear manager you are doing great job 
-1,The area is surrounded by homeless people so there is a strict minute time limit on eating inside the restaurant The bathrooms are locked and even asking multiple times to use one I was not given access My fiance found some kind of blueish chunk in his burger and that ended it for us Nice and clean but unfriendly staff and atmosphere and frightening food 
-1,Awful place ordered and ate my chicken tenders fries and drink Threw away the waste and sat back down to make a phone call McDonald s security kicked me out Said I couldn t stay more than min I was there minutes and there was other people in the restaurant Horrible 
-1,This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines I couldn t order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help She didn t know how to order that from the machine either She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large While I m waiting for my order another employee I think it was the manager told me I owed cents for the large orange juice She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didn t know how to order the large OJ I paid the cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was I won t be back to this particular McDonalds 
-1,We go here after almost every late night event we attend in Salt Lake City Concerts Jazz games Utes games Will probably find another place The Fries have been way below the McDonald s standard for the last few times and this last time they changed their ice cream completely Now the vanilla cones and the hot fudge sundaes are made with that cheap ice cream that is a cross between a terrible sorbet and cheap refrozen ice milk Truly disgusting At least the Cokes were but that won t bring us back 
-1,No one to take your order just really confusing monitor that took twice as long Took forever to get food and c it was still messed up Only high point was watching the security guard kicking out a few prior one who dropped drugs on the way out Too bad the next closest McDonald s was under repair Drive thru only 
-1,Like a box of chocolate you may get good service or terrible service Out of the times I have gone their over a week span I recieved decent service once I recomend to avoid this store
-1,This store s employees purposely turn off and reset their delivery systems payments if they dont feel like doing their job Absolutely horrid staff and all should be replaced 
-1,This McDonalds has really gone to The service Ignored After finally ordering They don t take the time to bring you your order or even call out your damn number Coffee sucks Oh And their security Whoever is hiring them should be fired with their security Total A holes who treat you like you re loitering after minutes Total judgmental A holes DONT VISIT THIS MCDONALDS
-1,This place is not hrs at all They need to fix it Been there a few times late or early and they signs saying use the ap but no one is in building and ap does not place order 
-1,Waited in line fire minutes and then they told us it was closed Terrible customer service with the worst night I v
-1,This is the worst McDonald s in the state and the worst one I ever visited in my life avoid it I revisit this location occasionally for the past years due to it s convenient location thinking it had to improve I am disappointed every time The staff here is extremely rude The food is poor quality Drive though time is long Don t know how this store passes McDonald s standards 
-1,ice cream machine is always broken literally always w
-1,Bad service No one knows the menu Says open hrs but drive thru opens at am Dine in not open either 
-1,I ve disliked McDonald s for a long time now they re always missing something of ours ice cream machine is always down their employees seem like they don t even know what to do I waited for this lady to take my money for minutes and all she did was look at me and took the drive thru orders So I just pulled up to the other window to pay and it took another minutes to friggin pay Never again going to ANY McDonald s ever 
-1,This place is a god damn joke My girlfriend and I went for egg mcmuffins at pm on a saturday night and it took over minutes to get our order The food quality was horrendous and no apology was given for the long wait AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS Seriously I don t expect gourmet food from Mcdonalds but this was truly disgusting One english muffin was so hard my girlfriend nearly broke a tooth on it My egg mcmuffin hadn t even been toasted The staff was unfriendly and unapologetic What a joke we are greatly disappointed in this location 
-1,Grossest McDonald s I have ever been to Dirty floors like deep dirt gum looking black marks But the worst part was the fly infestation Flies all over the food prep area and the tables Trying not to hurl while flies are landing on my head 
-1,Super dirty McDonald s Stopped to use washroom and the employee in the washroom was getting changed hands all over stuff in there and just walked out without washing his hands The same employee then walked out from behind the counter later and kicked some trash on the floor didn t even react to it or bother to clean it up Soda Pop syrup dried all over the drink station with lids and straws in absolute disarray Management here must be awful to allow this kind of behavior and terrible level of cleanliness 
-1,I just watched a vagrant peeing in a cup while eating my breakfast He then dumped his piss cup out on the sidewalk For God s sake ppl stop handing out money to hobos it just makes the issue worse He wasn t even handicapped yet he sat in a wheelchair I watched him for an hour When he didn t get any money from passing customers he stood up and walked away with his Help Please sign This McDonalds is filled woth hobos often and I won t be back 
-1,Terrible drive thru Super long wait even at an odd time of day Cold food less than great service and they handed me my drink half full flat and with the ice already melted 
-1,Honestly have never had a worse experience at a McDonald s The order confirmation screen is broken and the person taking orders apparently has not received training on reading back the order for accuracy Three out of three times I have been to this location they have messed up something major on the order The most recent time I got some serious attitude from the person taking orders Spend a few extra minutes to another location or go to Burger King 
-1,Turned away because I don t drive These are unprecedented times the lobby is closed and I am not allowed to order inside also told I am not allowed to order through the 
-1,Too anal about parking Parked there because had to stops McDonald s then the liquor store Went to the liquor store first because didnt want our food to get cold waiting at the liquor store that was packed Came back to drop off the bottle to go I to McDonald s and they booted my vehicle Wasn t even parked there minutes ExplaiNed to the guy that I was going I to McDonald s as well he didn t care He said I should have gone in McDonald s first Umm then I still would have gotten the boot foe leaving my vehicle there No win situation Well he took my last that was my grandkids dinner money to unboot it Can t return the liquor and couldn t buy them their dinner either Thanks McDonald s parking enforcement Real winners 
-1,I awoke one morning from a dream Wiping the sweat from my brow I tried to recall the details Table service at MacDonald s I heard my self say aloud I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality MacDonald s had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table I could order on the kiosk take a locator and lo and behold my order would appear before my very eyes It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonald s as quickly as possible as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there I arrived breath short and mouth whet and began the final steps of my journey My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting I got my usual a cheeseburger with no bun or patty and sat patiently gripping my locator like the staff of Moses The number seven sat abreast my locator the day God rested I too would rest I exclaimed aloud when my journey meets it s end as my food meets my table But in the next instant I was met with a fate worse than Gob s a thousand fold they called out my order from the counter and didn t bring it out to me My faith was shattered that day Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind Never again shall true happiness be known 
-1,This cash orders only stuff is getting old get better systems No other fast food restaurant has to do this so there s no reason you should 
-1,I couldn t place an order with a person at this location so we walked out and went somewhere else and ate The employees here needs to take a customer order instead of tell a person that they need to place an order at their self service machine We will not be coming back to this location
-1,the worst place to go that when the order was for my children and the answer was for me to leave because they were not going to attend to me

-1,Is this Mcdonalds or some strange car booting entity governed by sketchy people Very strange booting practices They film you leaving your car yet say nothing The sign is too high and barely visible They basically boot your car for not going straight to McDonald s I left to get a wine then grab something from Mcdonalds as well since i was hungry However on my way to liquor store an old man told me to go back grab my car since it will be booted It already had been booteed ONLY mins later when i ran back They wouldn t take it off so i kept complaining Hey said i should eaither pay now or after it s towed This is a disgusting practice in a first world country 
-1,A racist appalling and unacceptable behavior by the security and employees occurred today at this McDonalds My friend suffered a racist attack by some other white customer who asked the security to have them take my friend who is Hispanic out of the restaurant simply because of the white customers request This is shocking and disturbing behavior and needs to be remedied and addressed immediately This restaurant will suffer lawsuits very soon

-1,The minute wait time in the drive thru is no joke Management does not care At least the Homeless dude made some panhandling from all of the waiting cars Avoid the gridlock

-1,Put Straws In The Bag Maybe retrain your staff It 
-1,I would give a zero if I could I rarely if ever take time to give a bad review but I ordered pieces of nuggets and then they gave me Then when I tried to call the phone wouldn t work Finally when I walked back they acted like it was my fault because I forgot the other bag that they didn t bring out when the called my order Terrible place 
-1,Always seems to be a problem when we go at night after hours like between a a Be it a system failure stock depletion etc Also the employees are hardly ever happy or cordial in doing their job
-1,Don t seem to know how to read special orders especially when it comes to food allergies

-1,The worst McDonald s I ve ever seen The service is incredibly unpleasant and unwilling You enter a locator at the kiosk but you still have to go to the counter for your order Find out they haven t a cappuccino You ask what others can they offer you without an answer You talk about coffee with milk and you get something disgusting that doesn t even remotely resemble coffee Without apology with unpleasant looks and even with a rude comment among the employees Terrible customer service 
-1,You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before Probably because they ve all been shut down I ve been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy s for many many years and it s the same experience everytime At this point I do it for the entertainment The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster just for starters But you will usually wait minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out If you re lucky enough to get your food and it seems edible there s chance the dining room will be open With all that said it s not even the worst part The staff are the craziest rudest nastiest human beings you will ever experience They have zero filter They scream and curse at eachother and the customers One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce as if there s something wrong with that After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out telling me it was For sauce It was the best entertainment I ve ever received for the money 
-1,Beware this location I am a huge user of Mcdonald Happy Meal for my child so I know how to use a Mcdonald app order but this location is not working at all Furthermore the kiosk order system just takes the money from the credit card receipt paper was run out even the person register took my order twice for one happy meal I paid times for one happy meal I understand this place is overcrowded in the Macy s department but they can work better I won t go back to this location ever Worst place ever

-1,quarter pound deluxe no cheese why cant do job right salt even have no fry still ate unpleased i hate burger kung
-1,This staff does not regard the publicly posted hours or the manager does not pay them to clean up after hours I showed up at least hours before the publicly posted closing time and minutes before the closing time verbally expressed by the cashier Still they only had fountain drinks old coffee stale mcnuggets and ONE stale fish filet available They had decided to clean all equipment and stop making food well before closing Macy s is a long respected New York institution This lackluster and poorly run franchise is a detriment to a great store 
-1,What to say 
-1,The only reason I give this place a one is because there isn t a option this is the WORST McDonald s I ve ever been to The staff is RUDE We had to wait minutes to order when there wasn t anyone else in line Couldn t use the bathroom until we showed a receipt and then there was no toilet paper A worker brought paper towels up said there was no toilet paper and let his girlfriend jump in line in front of me to use the bathroom Couldn t even get in the men s bathroom the door was locked and you couldn t get in there Told the staff about it and they could care less I ve never been treated so poorly The guy that was guarding the stairs to the bathroom was a poor excuse for an employee and McDonald s is wasting their money on paying someone to treat customers poorly 
-1,Trash restaurant So rude and gave me what I didn t order I order large sweet tea with no ice First gave me large one with ice I said no ice Then waiting for long time gave me a small one with no ice So ridiculous Rude all the time Without any sorry and shame So never come back

-1,Hello I hope this email finds you to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can t be opened After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available after I asked why she said they just are I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise I left feeling I didn t have it my way And that s just a bowl movement Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist Best regards JJ

-1,Wow To say that we had a bad experience would be a compliment The food was cold they ran out of ice and carbonation yes no carbonation for the sodas and they still kept serving them we counted at least returned drinks in a minute spam Worst of all the manager offered no apologies Run don t just walk away from this place 
-1,i thought they closed this location down i cant believe i get to still read the reviews on this store and laugh they need to keep up the filth and rude customer service cause these comments are like comedy when you are bored 
-1,Absolutely disgusted with discriminatory management at this location As I m charging my phone in back making an order on app because I didnt have my card The manager Nancy request their security to kick me out I did absolutely nothing wrong other than charge my phone to make an order Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it s against rules to charge phone to make an order Only was charging to phone to make order thru app Then after getting kicked out they wouldn t give me a refund or my food said to call number Me being black I deal with this a lot But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior Still want my refund 
-1,I can t give it less than star otherwise I would have The staff have no idea what they re doing they walk around gaumlessly offering no help The counter is like a mosh pit Nothing works Avoid if you can or hope it s not busy at all otherwise you re in for a long wait with the wrong order by the end of it 
-1,My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the point of sales machine Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them I don t understand the yelling probably because they are in Spanish Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter It was my fault that I did not check realize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt TLDR just don s will always be a bad decision anyway 
-1,This is the most horrible place I have been to A guy walked out as we walked complaining he had waited minutes for a soda The guy on the register was so rude Very under staffed Homeless sleeping on the chairs We ordered coffees and frappes and waited so long to get them all at different times I worked at one in NZ and we would be fired for this kind of thing straight away 
-1,If I could give this place stars believe me I would By far the worst McDonald s I have EVER been to in the world I came in to buy a bottle of water would never even consider eating here given the lack of cleanliness I waited about five minutes until someone finally told me that they do not have any bottles left I told them a large fountain water was fine with ice Keep in mind MAYBE people at this McDonald s speak English Luckily this woman understood me when I communicated what I wanted I watched her get the cup fill it with ice and place it beside the machine For someone that is just waiting for a drink pour it and hand it to the customer There were maybe a dozen people waiting for their orders I did not have any other items to wait for just the water I waited another minutes to see if someone would just hand me the cup No one did I pushed my way through to the front and got my cup It was absolute chaos in there a brutally unorganized establishment The cashier could have simply turned around gotten me the bottle of water or in this case tell me there are none and pour me a fountain drink and be on my way Wasted minutes in this place 
-1,So many crazy homeless people come into this establishment just to sit lounge and disturb customers McDonald 
-1,This was hands down the SLOWEST McDonald s I have ever been to in the whole world The kitchen was full of employees so I m not sure why they didn t have their act together 
-1,Hope you have a lot of time because the wait here is unbelievable placing an order alone took me minutes I work nearby and out of times I ve been here in the overnight time they Weren t serving coffee any items on the value menu or any grilled items Not to mention how filthy it is Also always understaffed Horrible experience I don t usually eat McDonalds but working as an overnight around the area is one of the only places open has been like this for as long as I could remember Reason for this review is because it s unacceptable that they don t have coffee or value menu items available at nighttime when they should Wish I could give it stars 
-1,I ordered a latte from the Miami Beach Lincoln road branch and waited for my drink I saw my number flash up on the screen but no one called me I went up and asked the woman short reddish hair who was calling out the order numbers if my number had been called The answer was no I kept waiting and still nothing I asked her again but I was rudely ignored due to her having a chat with her friend I asked several different people working there about my latte but they all said it s coming and moved on The staff were either rude indifferent and just no longer interested in me after I had paid People came and went with their orders and I was left waiting for my one latte I said to one woman how long does it take to make a latte She looked at my ticket and of course no one had even started making it I was disgusted with the truly terrible customer service If u want good service do not go to this mcdonalds 
-1,Went here for a late night snack stop on Uber back to hotel Shows hours but the place was closed Ended up having to get two Uber s and pay twice as much as a result

-1,Employees are rude service is terrible took half an hour for me to get my meal Supervisor was yelling at customers about putting trash in the bins I asked for a cup of water and the girl said we don t have water but I can give you ice Is ice what I asked for If you don t have water how are you washing dishes How are you washing your hands 
-1,If I could give less starts I would do so Service is awful waited for the order for mins cheeseburger and coffee and finally got the food cold Can you image it Management team must be fired and new staff should be well trained prior starting working 
-1,When you want one of the main items on the list and they don t have it sock juice is better than the service in this location How are these people even allowed to work here Plants are nicer I have been to McDonald s in different countries and CONGRATULATIONS you are the WORST 
-1,The service was terrible my order it wasnt complete and when we talk with the Manager he yell at us and touch our french fries with his dirty hands Thanks to the cuban lady who change our fr es Don t Come to this place you 
-1,AVOID The biggest disappointment about this restaurant is the total lack of service mindedness of the staff They got our order wrong we ordered a dubble cheese burger and got a regular cheese burger instead and their solution was to take said burger and simply slap another patty in it before giving it back They also forgot to include items in our order like sauces and such and they couldn t give us a reciept after our purchase When my friend asked one staff member for the sauces he ordered she only spoke spanish to him even though he made it clear that he didn t understand her After some time and finally getting the sauces the staff laughed as he left At least the place was some what clean Seriously avoid there are a lot of better food places nearby 
-1,Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know I was looking within the mall area because of the map description and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see When I entered to place an order one of the cashier s had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers and unfriendly look I didn t like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl assuming a toy choice here I get the order no toy And asked all they said was no toy sorry I left I m not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead at least I was charged for double only 
-1,I don t know where to start OMG This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world Staff act like if they were on vacation You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for mins just to order and pay From this point it was exactly mins until my order was ready All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction Here they re just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers 
-1,Waited one hour for a piece chicken nugget happy meal Disorganized unapologetic and zero customer service The kiosk machine for fast service was anything but that They lost my order and the manager didn t want to step up to admit so 
-1,If I couldn t give a star I would because the service over there is poorly I order a salad and they did not give me a fork so I asked for for one I was standing there for minutes and then I asked her again for it and she told me no Worst service ever 
-1,Absolutely the worst customer service I ve experienced in my years I was in line waiting to order mind you the line was so long you would have thought they were giving food away and just as I get to the front of the line the cashier just walks away and says nothing I wait about minutes and ask is he returning to take orders and was told no we only have one line now The employees were rude the lines were unbelievably long and it took about minutes to order and receive your food TheMcDonald sfromHELL
-1,Fantastic service Came in around breakfast time and My wife was told that McDonald s doesn t have fries and continually asked if they would ever have fries and was told no fries Legit this was better than the comedy show I saw in the cruise before stopping by here Must see during yorr trip to Miami 
-1,The food is average here like all McDonald s nothing so bad like cold food or anything the bad part about this location is that it somewhat seems to be a safe haven for bums and schizophrenic drug addicts Everytime I have ever went here I am approached by someone asking for money or food its ridiculous it s like they all hide in there and come out to beg when a new customer enters Last time I was there a bum with an injured leg was high on crack or something and scratching his open wound with the gauze removed completely disgusting miami filthy 
-1,This McDonald s is extremely busy and the service is terrible After waiting for over minutes for my sundae I finally flagged down an employee and complained Then she made it Just a couple of hours previously I watched someone fill my drink order and put it on a counter where it was subsequently ignored by the other employees who were handing out orders for minutes They have a computer system just like other McDonald 
-1,Shocking the worst McDonald s ever The staff were dressed in their own clothes leant on the till ignoring customers and looked put out when having to serve They moved the slowest I ve ever seen a human move the were lethargic and made it clear they couldn t care less All of them Out of two orders they got both wrong It s a testament to McDonald s that their general standards are so high across the world in my experience that this terrible restaurant stands out as an exception Whoever does their quality audits needs sacking or spend more time there 
-1,Rudest employees I ve seen anywhere I ve been Whomever is the manager and allows employees to act like this needs to be fired or maybe that s why they are stuck at McDonald s 
-1,I walked away from my table and when I returned someone had drunk my coffee Straight outta the cup what a nerve While the cleaning lady was right there 
-1,I would give zero stars if I could I went in to use the restroom I was told it was out of service I told the young lady at the counter that I understood it was late and they don t usually allow ppl you use the restrooms after a certain time but I was having an emergency and knew no where else to go I was willing to make a purchase in exchange I pretty much just paid to use the restroom bc the food was old and very disgusting I was shocked There was a group ahead of me Everytime they asked for something they were told it wasn t available and had to order things they didn t want I was told I couldn t get a medium fry I had to purchase a large Like really I m grateful to the young lady for letting me use the restroom but it was also extremely gross Who is running this place

-1,Customer service sucks walk to counter to order my meal the Male cashier with inch painted fake finger nails was rude said something rude in spanish i dont care to repeat and walked away before i could place my order as if I wasn t good enough for him to take my order However he did have time to come into the lobby and joke around with other Hispanic guests I had to place my order with another cashier who was sufficient My food was thrown into a bag and shoved at me by another crew member All of the food was cold and the sweet tea tasted of coffee grounds All of the tables were dirty and sticky Having dined in and watched this gross misconduct happen to several guest Having been a former Manager of a McDonald s it was a duty to share this experience with your company To be honest if this store was in any other location it would go out of business for extremely horrible customer service and filthy establishment If i had been a serect shopper or health inspector this location would have failed 
-1,Great food great location entertaining rude employees and clothing is optional Food works like a tasty laxative you are sure to go within two hours Cuban employee screams out the numbers in spanish while pregnant employee says Customer should turn gay because he is not picking Up any of the female employees Another employee has a nasty cold and was mixing a lemon with hot water Another Customer was told by pregnant comedic employee if he did not like their Service he should go eat on Ocean Drive

-1,A Restaurant without a Restroom In the Pandemic And no Sanitizer With capacity of over seats In South beach Miami Possibly coz the profit is not good to pay a cleaner You should say Mcdonalds partners coz the customers use the surrounding restaurants and streets to wash their hands or to pee Still Unique coz you cant find this in suburbans of Delhi or Khartoum Shame 
-1,A true rip off They automatically upgrade you for a large meal without asking you anything I didn t realize right away When I went back to the register the girl said that s how it was if you don t specify you want a regular meal Where else have you seen that She didn t apologize or offer me to refund the difference or anything I asked to talk to a manager and she said she was the manager Waow what a customer service Anyway it s not for how much extra you pay it s just the fact that Mac Donald is a big corporation and shouldn t allow that kind of policy because the place is packed of tourists and staff take advantage of it It s unbelievable to treat customer that way

-1,Unbelievable that everyone else has the same complaint as me they never get the order right Tonight I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family I first tried to call just to get reimbursed but no one answered the phone Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table When I got to the drive thru I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot Having worked in the food industry myself in the past the service was awful For the sheer inconvenience they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge However all that was given was a refund not even an apology to go along with it Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home thanks to my having to drive back for a refund Mistakes can happen but not as often as they happen here Do yourselves a favor and avoid this location 
-1,Twice I ordered iced coffee from this location Both times the iced coffee tasted horrible That s my last time going to that place They really need to get t
-1,Location a bit of an inconvenience service could have been better Cashier was slow did not ring up my order correctly had on gloves and was touching his hat money pulled his phone out of his pocket several times and was handling food this is not sanitary Not happy at the fact that we waited for minutes for large fries as we watched the drive thru serve other orders before ours and we were the only customers inside at the time Having worked for mcdonalds in the past I know for a FACT it takes just a little over minutes to fry a full basket of fries which leads large fries And if they had baskets down at once which they did then there should be no reason to have had us wait for so long Will not return to this location 
-1,This is the most disorganized Mc Donalds I have been to in my life They are the slowest most unprofessional and disrespectful one that I have ever seen I live at the corner so I did not have a single experience It was multiple ones and it is always the same terrible service Once I had to wait minutes for a simple and should be quick coffee But the last time I went there was the worst I stayed around minutes in the counter and nobody was capable to ask me if was in need of something I was picking an order up which took me almost hour minutes until somebody talked to me minutes waiting for the food They are just always so messy that from now on every time I want to eat a burger I consider first going to Wendy s or Jack in the Box or another Mc Donalds store not this one anymore
-1,Lobby closed early and would not take our order in the drive through even though we were paying customers clearly displaying their classism as we did not have a car Encouraged two inebriated individuals in front of us to come back with in car recommended getting a DUI 
-1,Slowest fast food ever
-1,Had to buy a coffee to ask for the bathroom only to be told it s closed We re only open for take out even though I walked into the restaurant No amount of pleading would make the cashier budge on what to me was urgent The standard answer of the age for any garbage policy today is Covid 
-1,I ve never had so many orders be wrong in my life I just tested different orders over days all didn t times if day yes I get board easily and not a single one was right Not little stuff like napkins but like burgers fries and drinks missing Yesterday it was a mc flurry Before asking for it directly I even asked knowing they forgot it am I missing anything and got a nope you re good have a nice day well at least it was with a smile 
-1,They lie saying they are closed to not prepare your order
-1,Generally you know what you re getting when you go to a McDonald s drive thru but not at this location Burgers were messy and not stacked properly fries were almost inedible soggy and barely room temp Hard pass go somewhere else 
-1,Been to this location times now and have NEVER had a good experience The first two times I waited minutes with only a couple of cars in front of me the first time and NONE in front of me the nd The first time was so bad that the whole line of cars were honking and going over the curbs to get out of line These people take FOREVER and are rude as hell Not sure if they need new management or a whole new workforce but this place is AWFUL Let 
-1,I ve lived next to this McDonald s for over years and never go in because of the overwhelming number of vagrants in and around the building I have two kids now and they of course like McDonald s They recently renovated it so I was optimistic and took them in there for breakfast Right away there was a bum outside the door yelling to himself and when we walked in there was another one lying on the ground next to the tables I went back a month later for happy meals and the kids wanted to eat there All the tables and floors were dirty and they still had bums outside and in While we were waiting for the food a homeless guy wanted to use the bathroom but there was a lock on it When he asked a worker they said it was for customers only and the homeless guy started only a block from my house 
-1,I have traveled all across the world I have eaten at McDonald s in the UK Japan Mexico and across America The McDonald s at Garnet Ave in Pacific Beach has to be the very worst Mcdonald s ever This reflects on the managers and poorly trained staff The staff is very rude and incompetent I now travel to the other Mcdonald s on Mission Bay Dr The staff are polite well trained and food is always hot fresh and up to Mcdonald s standard quality 
-1,Physically waited in line for a hour while the drive thru and uber eats received seniority Most had already walked away after placing an order with random folks taking what they can get unchecked as the attendants stopped caring after the first minutes Please close this location as it is no longer viable
-1,Horrible absolutely Horrible Never will I eat at this mcdonalds I live in North County and I never had horrible service like I did today Very slow staff Angry managers Very understaffed They messed up a lot of orders back to back There was a lot of people waiting for their order They messed up my order twice and it took them forever to replace my order There is homeless people here panhandling Management is absolutely awful They would never let a place like this run in North County I expected more from this place Worst experience ever The staff had horrible attitudes min later I got diahrrea idk what they put in my food but definitely not coming back

-1,I wanted to use the app to redeem a free kids meal with a kids meal purchase I asked if they take coupons from the app and the woman said no Then I asked why not and she said she didn t know I should have asked for a manager but I didn t When I went to pick up my order I did ask the manager and he said they do take the coupons from the app I told him the cashier said they didn t so I was not able to use my coupon The manager looked at her like he was annoyed and told her she should have asked if she didn t know Then they talked in spanish and started laughing with each other 
-1,Almost didn t even get to order half our or cuz they told us to pull up to the second window before my bf got to order what he wanted We asked for sweet sour only got BBQ Ranch We didn t get straws And the fries we got we re stale When we tried to call back to try get a refund it went to a fax machine Wasn t even busy at the time 
-1,This location is horrible I ordered at the kiosk and I got a locator for my table that clearly stated that I can sit down and relax and the food will be taken to me That did not happen They were yelling my number over and over and even made eye contact with me and clearly saw the locator on my table and still didn t bring me my food When I asked why I was given a locator for my table the manager simply responded We don t do that here Workers were not polite at all The women s bathroom had no toilet paper I had to wipe with a toilet seat cover 
-1,This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced We have stopped a few times and the greeting I get is always what do you want I say hello thankyou and have a good day at the window and they basically throw my food at me Sadly the only nice person has told me sorry for the wait we don t have enough workers

-1,Manager on duty Ignacio extremely hostile and rude I am an Uber driver and I have visited this location two weekends in a row It is a very busy location on Saturday evenings On my first visit I went to the drive thru and ordered worth of food and then parked and ran inside to ask to use the restroom he told me I had to pay a quarter I then explain to him that I just had come through the drive thru and I was a customer he said oh well you have to pay a quarter On my second visit one week later I walked in ordered a coffee and politely asked him for a token for the restroom Ignacio appeared to become upset by my request so much so that he actually tossed it at me hard enough for it to bounce off the counter and land on the floor He did not apologize he just walked off I feel he should be reprimanded for his blatant disrespect and rude Behavior towards paying customers If this location is too much for him to handle maybe he should transfer somewhere else I will never return to this McDonald s again as long as the manager Ignacio is in charge 
-1,Quarter Pounder was actually missing the meat patty French fries tasted like they were cooked last week Still took minutes in the drive through with only one other car 
-1,Chips were not hot and staff seemed too busy to talk when I tried to get condiments There was a few customers but the bag was basically thrown at you and then you were never looked at again Edit I ve since been back and my friend had to wait minutes for a Coke They then tried to claim they d called it when they had clearly forgotten about it as it was sitting on the drinks machine with no lid Not sure what the management of the place is like but they d want to change something Staff are awful and rude

-1,Franchise owners need to hire more staff to keep up with demand
-1,The owner of this McDonald s needs to read this When you have a breakfast special you should want to please the customer If the customer wants sausage biscuits instead of bacon biscuits are a customer would prefer a a certain type of bread for there breafast sandwich special you should not put stipulations on what type of bread they want Other McDonald s have catered to my needs if your not willing to cater to customer needs then you will have less customers Also charging for ranch not everyone can eat ketchup because of acid and stomach problems and need ranch for there fries instead of ketchup Anyone that says they need ranch for there fries are hashbrown not just chicken nuggets because they have stomach issues you should make exception to that for that And one last thing Your workers look miserable not one of them smiles at me im very outgoing person You need to explain to your workers that there attitudes are sour and need to cheer up We all have bad days but when somone looks like they hate being there based off of there unfriendly customer service then they need more training Night service is better from my experience but the morning service needs to be looked at It s not fun to drive up and the worker gives you that look like they hate you and shows no customer service skills at all Thank you for your understanding Take my advice and you will have more customers

-1,We are frequent customers of this restaurant While the food was good the inside was a mess Every garbage can was overflowing with stacks of garbage piled up on all of them The tables were littered with paper and garbage There were papers all over the floor even by the register At the drink station there were scattered cups and catsup splattered on the counter and floor Counter service was excruciatingly slow Since we really like the renovation and usually great service we will probably give it one more shot We were there almost a half hour and so no one in the front cleaning Hopefully they can address and correct the problem 
-1,In a rush to get a lunch after hours of work and the cashier takes an employee before me even though I was next in line No biggie until the employee orders something so messed up the cashier has to ask someone how to punch it in and then needs help again to give the employee the discount I ve never had a good experience at this McDonald s 
-1,Wow This McDonald s is beyond awful So many bad experiences For one outside the place smells like a landfill The inside is covered in flies and old decorations from months ago Every table is dirty the bathrooms are atrocious and the garbage is overflowing If that were tolerable the food certainly is it There s always something wrong with the order or the food is old and stale or overcooked We have had multiple issues with their soft drinks machine Either the soda is warm there is no carbonation or both If someone suggests I go to this McDonald s again I ll kindly tell them I ll eat my own foot after trouncing around in manure There s no reason that cheap food has to be so lacking in quality 
-1,Horrible manager there a woman by the name of Marsha I believe or start with an M i I v Been waiting for the food for mins and she tells me if I don t want to wait I should leave How can a manager tells this I am sure there is some sort of conduct policy or else she wouldn t been a manager
-1,It was horrible order from inside and it was a min wait for food Ridiculous for meals 
-1,Since their new building has opened it takes FOREVER to get your food It s supposed to be fast food and it takes minutes in the drive through and then they gave my kids toddler toys when I did not ask 
-1,Worst service in years pm at night Only car in the drive thru minutes for chicken tenders and fries No explanation given We are working on it The team s teenage friends inside however were getting personalized service with their coffees 
-1,This place has the worst service they kept giving us the wrong order and actually had his pay for someone else s the area took a while to correct and then we still had to wait for our food for another minutes or so This was all done through the drive thru and I expected better service the New York City from this place but I definitely didn t get it the food actually wasn t that good either I remember feeling sick after I got home later so I definitely don t recommend going to this McDonald s 
-1,These people can t get an order straight to save their lives We went in with an order that was WRITTEN DOWN CLEARLY and was very precise times we had to go back to the counter The last time my sand which was dropped on the floor picked up wiped off put in the container and handed to me I got the entire incident captured on my phone and when I confronted the person they denied my sandwhich even fell This place is all around terrible Save yourself the risk of salmonella poisoning and drive the miles to Plattsburgh Your health will thank you I d give zero stars if it were possible Here We freaking go again Tried one last time tonight was very specific with our order which wasn t very hard to begin with and guess what A complete and total failure These people just don t Care Do yourself A favor and drive the extra miles to Plattsburgh 
-1,This place seriously needs some funding from the head office to renovate and modernize the dinning area Washrooms are deplorable Considering the amount of Canadian traffic that passes through Champlain I believe most would like a pit stop for lunch while traveling down to the states a renovation would be warranted and I think most people would enjoy eating here more often 
-1,During a severe thunderstorm I told my son to pull over and get indoors He was right near Mcdonalds in Champlain and he went in and ordered some food After he got his food they kicked my son out and said he couldn t hang around due to covid right in the middle of the worst part of the storm Use some common sense Mcdonalds and have a heart 
-1,They took the fast out of fast food today Always pull ahead at window I remember when you use get your food from that window If the machine breaks down we break down

-1,Was asked to leave because the dining room was closed however there are no signs stating that the dining room was closed This was after we ordered on the kiosk in the lobby that said nothing about the dining room being close as well The food was poorly prepared it was a mess 
-1,Lacking in customer service Wouldn t substitute steak for sausage in big breakfast Even after we said we would pay extra Biscuits were hard Bathroom was nasty Only good thing worth the one star was the coffee 
-1,Tired of getting cold half filled frys They would not serve half a tea Why serve half a fry 
-1,This is the worst McDonald s ever they are very slow they screw up our order every time we go there we are done with this place today I asked for hamburgers I got cheeseburgers wth we are always asking for our cup for our soda at times we could stand there for more than min before being waited on never again 
-1,They don t listen They gave us really cold fry s The Dr Pepper was flat The manger was very rude I ask for light lettuce and extra sauce on my big mac And they put big load of lettuce and very little sauce THEY DONT LISTEN 
-1,Absolutely awful get your stuff together McDonalds Yes their food tastes good but the place it s self is horrid If you are in a rush which most of us are since it s fast food don t come to this one Without a doubt they will get your order completely wrong They have literally messed up my order times in this past week I order iced peppermint coffee and they never give it to me even though it says it on my receipt it s always hot coffee they give me One of the orders messed up my coffee so bad that it was just a hot coffee with just creamer in it no sugar or flavor even though I asked for iced peppermint mocha I ordered pies and they didn t even give me them plus picante sauce comes with the breakfast burritos yet they never give me it either Mess up my McChicken just about every time I order it This happens very often but this time it threw me over the edge since it was so frequent this week Champlain s McDonalds is the worse by far that I have been to 
-1,Was going through and the family decided we should get McDonald s seeing how we were about minutes till they closed was gonna just get something small went to the drive thru and no one answered pulled to the front and saw about people just looking at us weird then turning to each other and laughing not satisfied with them at all
-1,What staff they had were working hard but the place was a mess in service was very slow 
-1,Slow service Kids working don 
-1,Normally decent food for a McDonald s restaurant however if you order a frozen drink they make it first so it sits there and melts No matter what time of day it s always the same Don 
-1,Terrible service and terrible management Paid with gift cards and dollars cash for my meal you would think I would get change back but she hands me back a gift card Tells me the change is on the card Gave me back an empty gift card tried using it in plattsburgh on rt McDonald s manager informed me it was empty So I guess thievery as well goes with their reputation
-1,The McDonald s in Champlain NY is a great place to grab something to eat and to be honest I just came here last night on my way to Altona to play the slot machines and I really enjoy coming to this McDonald s and it s way far better than the one is in my town where I live and it s like Night And Day compared to this one and I just as well give this place a Star Rating and the other one is a Star Rating and if I had the opportunity to give it a BIG FAT ZERO I REALLY WOULD AND I DON T THINK THAT IT S FAIR TO REVIEWER S TO HAVE TO GIVE IT A STAR WHEN THEY DON T DESERVE IT This McDonald s here in Swanton VT is probably the worst place to get so called fast food I go through the drive thru too order my food but before I do go too McDonald s I always make sure that I have a full tank of gas in my car Because by the time I get my food I ve already waisted at least bucks in gas by the time I leave this place I believe that if it s going too take a half hour or more to finally get my very Luke Warm Garbage then this McDonald s should not be allowed to call themselves a part of the Fast Food Chain If you want to get something quick to eat then don t go to this McDonald s here in Swanton and their service is terrible and the food is even worse 
-1,Only been there once before today I remember why it s horrible had to wait for my food for them to not even give it all to me

-1,I would Give this McDonald s stars if I could they don t only forget your sauces for your nuggets but they give you a Burger with a paper still on the Patty cooked with cheese on it I bit into my Burger and I chewed it right away I tasted the paper Took my Burger apart and found the paper that s on the Burger Patty before it s cooked Be more careful People could get sick if they eat that It would be nice if I could get my money back for this

-1,On Nov I went to use the men s restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often

-1,So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonald s in regards to what I m doing doordash Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people 
-1,Really rude staff too bad service Avoid if you can There are so many other better places to eat or drink around They would literally cheat you 
-1,Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location we couldn t eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by I understand they can t help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald s location then you should definitely avoid this location 
-1,This plave is not a good place They used to have blacks there too Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race I though McDonald s was equal opportunity employer Guess not Today I went there to use the restroom I was told I couldn t use the restroom unless I bought something I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way I asked to speak to the manager the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I ll be in and out that s all I need it and I was still denied Every time I come to this place is always something Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait to minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her I wasn t really strong with expressing myself oh now I express myself a little bit more I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn t a nice place to be I wouldn t give them a dime of my money When did they treat people and I ve always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald s along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald s down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty disrespectful unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California Let s get back together McDonald s or else I ll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it s like this McDonald s We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they ve had experiences at McDonald s that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who ve walked out of McDonald s and see if they ll never come back I don t think we want this to be a topic of discussion 
-1,I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didn t even put the bacon on it The bacon that I spend my money on and now they didn t put the onion on it 
-1,Very bad exp I believe I goten bad food 
-1,if you re a tourist DON T go to McDonald s especially this one rude service poor choice worst fast food chain in US by far
-1,No dollar menu anything but drinks here Even coffee is bucks The service is spotty and confusing at best The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier ultra poor planning on space for quality of service business There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless 
-1,Worst McDonald s in the world that s a big statement but its the only one that fits I ordered breakfast on a Saturday It wasn t too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier Save your money go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible To clarify I m not bagging on all McDonald s I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible my suggestion is to go elsewhere
-1,Got my order wrong took forever to serve my sweet tea Crispy chicken had a large piece of not so crispy chicken w the foulest tasting sauce I ll never order again watered down sodas so much you d think it was club soda Never again
-1,We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup What exactly were we supposed to do with that Meanwhile others got a decent sized cup for water What do you lose to give out a cup of WATER 
-1,This McDonald s is always very busy so I understand why their customer service isn t the best Even so I still don t understand
-1,Worse Mac Donald s on the planet and the most discussing rudest staff I 
-1,This was an ok McDonald s but I liked going to this place because it was so busy during the summer so you are more likely to get hot and fresh food Now that it s December they are slacking I guess they are having more problems with the homeless or druggies or drug dealers outside of their business but twice in the last two weeks I got cold and half cooked fries after pm Maybe because I m a gang stalking victim this is happening REPORT ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE On December th I got the free double cheeseburger it was a cold burger a
-1,Go anywhere else Not here Beyond the counter this place is never clean Glorified truck stop Too many other options next door and nearby that are more deserving of your business Especially since the dining room is no longer open hours No drive through Sad Literally steps from the pier The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks The homeless aren t the issue It is the mentally disturbed the hustlers and questionable addicts This is not a family friendly location Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat No other business has these issues Not one Food No problems

-1,Overall great place to just look just look The pizza was not the disappointment but the decision in ordering the pizza If anyone wants to eat nasty pizza I recommend buying frozen pizza It takes mins to get the pizza upon ordering it It has no cheese and the toppings were underwhelming The frozen pizza in your local grocery might be a better option 
-1,If I could give it no stars i would Me and my family have been coming to Florida for yrs straight now and we always wanted to stop here but it was always packed and we could never get in So tonight we were fortunate to get in with no traffic and when I say I wish we would ve kept going st I would start off with its over crowed inside very unorganized and no manager direction Ordered our food at pm got our order at my niece ordered a Belgian waffle at on the dot at pm it still wasn t ready so I asked very politely bc I m a very nice person if they had made our order for the waffle the guy said it wasn t ready but we stood there watching them make waffles and throw them on the shelf so I asked was of the waffles my order he went to check each ticket and sadly not of them was my the order I also witnessed him ask of the workers about it She was an older woman when I say she was very rude didn t care and walked off as he was asking her so at that point I just wanted a refund Oh no but it doesn t stop there got in the car my whole order was cold and the lack of work they put into making food is ridiculous I do not recommend this place and we will never come here again My burger was missing a whole top layer of meat lettuce cheese and sauce This is beyond ridiculous I was so exhausted with this place I just took it as a lose and went back to our place of stay This is the worst McDonald s ever 
-1,I ve been to the USA times since for both business and leisure In the s of course it was the dream to go to a US McDonald s they sell root beer I ve had Big Macs in LA NYC Seattle and Boston And now Orlando This restaurant looks nice and modern from the road but as soon as you step in it is dirty deep down dirty with dirty tables and dirty floors The layout means there are very few seats down stairs so up we went and discovered some giant soft play area arcade machines they didn seriously There isn t a single vegetarian in Florida And no root beer The days of quick convenient fast food are really over for McDonalds and I witnessed it a
-1,Growing up in Orlando I visited this location as a child and knew the Oerther family Decided to take my child here for her first visit and sadly was left pretty infuriated First I timed it and it took minutes for us to receive our order We had to stop and ask an employee what the hold up was When they finally brought our order out to us my daughter was missing her drink which you can clearly see on the receipt is there Tea Lemonade I asked another employee about it he took my receipt and never came back So I had to leave my hot food and go stand at the front for a good minutes just to ask a third person for the drink How hard is it just to give me a cup that I clearly didn t receive and I will just make it myself at a machine They gave me a card to come back for a free meal and apologized but it was beyond frustrating for a McDonalds meal The peanut butter cake was delicious and it looks like the ack in service 
-1,It s a great location if you want to wait minutes for extremely subpar food Fries are stale food is bland as hell and in pretty sure there is mold on one of my sandwiches Also come here so the kid could burn off energy but the playplace was closed Annnyyyyyways Probably won t return 
-1,One of the worst McDonald s I ve ev
-1,Nope just nope Stay away Not worth your sanity at all First it s packed So very packed When I went the game room up stairs with the huge play ground the air wasn t working half of the games were broken they are so short staffed there is no employee to redeem your tickets The play area wasn t well cleaned at all and the bathrooms weren t kept up I m sure do to the fact they are so very busy and short staffed The pizza was good and the peanut butter cake was good But not worth the hype especially with all the craziness that was going among many other issues 
-1,This location fed me raw chicken I ordered spaghetti with McCrispy and half way through the McCrispy it turns out raw 
-1,We waited min for burgers and chicken nuggets Everything was cold I asked for hot food so they put everything in the trash and I waited another min to get my order h to have my order in this Fast Food No one apologized I do not recommend going there if you are in a hurry All the tables around us waited at least min 
-1,The World s Largest McDonald s turns out to also be the world s noisiest Aside from the fact that our order wasn t fully delivered to our table and our order was wrong the nd floor is a chaotic thrum of children
-1,Unfortunately it s not got any better The first time visiting this trip and they got my order wrong I didnt have much faith to begin with to be honest The attention to detail here is lacking And for a latte is unreal Tourist trap central Cross the road to checkers and get good food at a low price
-1,With a year old we visit McDonald s every so often this place was just awful Ordered regular mcnuggets a large fries couple drinks and a happy meal min wait spicy nuggets in the boxes no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want Drinks are just cups despite the machine asking what we want self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc Nuggets were over cooked Like properly crunchy jerky texture Fries were literally stone cold not even warm Our kid loved the play centre but this isn t worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonald s for just plain terrible food and no service at all
-1,The biggest waste of time and money Way to packed Unorganized There was barely a line when we got to McDonald s yet we still waited over an hour for bacon mcdoubles a big Mac a bacon chicken ranch they forgot the bacon when it s literally IN THE TITLE and medium fries Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was cold and disgusting Spent way more money than it should have been Will NOT be going back there The kids didn t even want to play in the play area because they ended up getting hurt Poorly set up and no security or anything They were being pushed and shoved by other children and no one was doing anything about it 
-1,Where should I start Service was exceptional BAD I was missing half of my order and had to go down stairs and bring the rest of my order they was missing back upstairs which was alot of hassle to do Also would ve been very helpful if there was a refill station upstairs The atmosphere was way too overcrowded I don t really fault McDonald s for this but it didn t make the experience pleasant Overall I would skip this place if I see a parking lot full of cars 
-1,My friend s and I decided to visit the world s largest McDonald s tonight while on our holiday to Orlando The visit was absolutely abysmal We got table service which took over minutes to come drinks a cheese burger and McNuggets and once we received our order only of it was there When we ask staff about the rest of our order they just walked away and were no help at all So I went to the front desk and had to wait for a further minutes to be seen I eventually got the rest of the order but by which time the food was now cold By far the worst experie
-1,Worst place to visit My kids love McDonald s so we wanted to try the largest McDonald s This was the worse idea ever We waited over an hour to get our food The food was wrong We ha
-1,Our World s Biggest McDonald s adventure started with an appetizer an appetizer consisting of the smile and excitement of my McDonald s loving younger brother Then came the st course the tears of my girlfriend as she gazed upon her small serving of pasta while her fingers felt the stone cold chill of her fries Our meal ended with the return of my absolutely revolting Chicken Alfredo which led the the main course of a Big Mac a Big Mac has never failed me until today With the measliest of beef patties and sauce on the side yes they missed the burger I was astonished by the lack of quality this McDonald s provided Also my brother s Pizza took an hour to be served and then he was argued with would not recommend fire everybody 
-1, not recommended Waited for our food for over minutes Didn t even receive what we ordered Parking is a nightmare not worth it just because they have pizza You c
-1,Worst McDonalds experience I have had in all my life Place was chaotic from the moment we walked in but for some reason that didn t put us off Waited for ages to receive our food and when it did arrive half of it wasn t there and some of it was cold Tried to find a helpful member of staff we re still looking Went to get some drinks all of which were horrible as quoted by another customer even the water tasted like sewage We ended up leaving with what we had and wondering how long the symptoms of cholera take to set in So safe to say we wouldn t recommend and would not return Horrible 
-1,Absolute free for all inside A automated factory that completely doesn t work People waiting over min for their food nearly every order was wrong and staff just literally ignoring the countless customers complaining The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to report This place simply doesn t work and is utter chaos almost an hour and wrong food with no one to care
-1,Fries were cold nuggets were soft the burgers were gross the upstairs smelled sweaty and gross ordered food and the place was busy and my child needed to use the bathroom so I took the card with our number to the bathroom because I didn t want them leaving my food alone at the table and they came over and yelled at us for moving around the mcdonalds honestly do not recommend It is not worth it Go find a regular McDonald s and a park close by 
-1,This was a horrible experience and a waste of hours and almost The place was terribly overcrowded and dirty There was standing room only shoulder to shoulder We stood in line for minutes at a kiosk to order then after we ordered it said there was an error and we had to wait another minutes in the line at the register anyway to order All of the workers were super rude I was even on the elevator with workers talking about a customer saying I have no obligation to answer your questions or do anything for these people and then talking about how gross a customer was and saying she would point her out to the other employee Nobody was at all helpful and even seemed to be angry when we asked for anything My daughter tried to fill her cup with sweet tea and the older lady standing at the drink station didnt let her fill it up all the way The only nice person was the old guy emptying the trash on the nd floor We spent over for my kids to play the arcade games then they shut and locked the prize counter A while later we had to ask someone to open it so they could redeem their tickets and employees tried over the course of the next hour and no one could get it back open I tried talking to a manager about it but she gave me about seconds of her time just to tell me there was nothing she could do but send someone up to the ticket counter for us she didn t even listen to us explain that it others had tried before she just walked away We are from out of state and my kids were so excited to see this place but we all left miserable At least the sandwiches were warm though the fries were soggy 
-1,Over crowded hard to find a parking spot for it to be the largest McDonald s in the U S over an hour to get a Big Mac meal Ordered a pizza that came before the big Mac meal The pizza was very salty yeah I guess that s what you get when ordering pizza at a McDonald s My kids ordered pasta and were also disappointed 
-1,We came here all the way from Hungary excited to try out a real american McDonald s Unfortunately our experience could not have been worse After over minutes of waiting I got my Big Mac delivered to our table cold which I honestly would 
-1,This McDonald s did not live up to the hype I saw on the internet It was crowded and small I entered and all of my expectations dropped I ordered at the kiosk since the line was long All of the items I ve seen online through social media were either unavailable or not there at all I saw the famous pizza and pasta I tried the pizza After ordering my food and sweets I waited at the only table I could find that wasn t already taken I ordered a small drink so I figured if I had to wait maybe they would at least bring me the cup so I can get a drink I was wrong I made a special request for my McFlurry and within minutes of ordering I was told my special request couldn t be done since they had already made my McFlurry I thought they would make the ice cream items last so they don t melt while waiting for the food I didn t order much and I know there was a line but I received the pizza faster than anything I waited for a total of minutes for the rest of my food They waited until everything was done to bring it to me and it wasn t even good The chicken was dry and looked old my burger was cold my McFlurry was made wrong so I didn t eat that and they gave me the wrong slice of cake very disappointed The pizza was the only food item that didn t suck entirely It was very thin but tasted okay Definitely wouldn t go back ever again Not worth the trip or the hype 
-1,My family was dining there and the people that was with us got their food way before us I waited for an hour before deciding to inquire about mine and my daughters pasta dishes I stood in line for about ten minutes when a member of management came They went to look for it Was just sitting under a heat lamp We will never step foot in that McDonalds again We ordered our food at pm and got our food at pm Shame on you McDonalds
-1,Used a ice cream cone reward The machine was broken and asked me if I wanted something else I said a mango smoothie They ended up giving me strawberry banana Furthermore visited again and they never had my order took mins for someone to help rd time didn t print receipt and the customer service was horrible but the whole time he had the ability to print a duplicate Stay away if you don t want to deal with them 
-1,Too crowded tables were a mess and they took almost mins to have our food ready when we ask for it they weren t too helpful friendly The upstairs AC wasnt running or something was wrong it was too hot overall it just seems like they were understaffed for the amount of people there 
-1,Thoroughly disappointed with our visit Food took ages and was mediocre at best The air con didn t work so we were sweltering Used the arcade half the machines did not work had to wait half an hour to get prizes The staff were rude and unhelpful I would advise not to bother visiting 
-1,They have an arcade upstairs but no one working in the arcade and play area No one is available to redeem tickets for prizes Who wants to leave without their prize not my kid 
-1,Overcrowded and rude employees when we went Overhyped in my opinion Just browse the pictures on the internet and call it good There s no need to visit this place Smaller jungle gym than we thought and too overcrowded with kids shoving each other and climbing over each other We wanted to try the pizza but they closed shortly after we arrived Mind you it was open when we first arrived but we had to wait in a ridiculously long line only to find out they closed while we were waiting and
-1,Had to wait minutes to redeem video game tokens Long line of people waiting Ended up leaving Unacceptable Do better McDonald s 
-1,The building looked good and It had a lot of stuff but the employees didn t even know the food or how it was supposed to be made when they gave us the food we were missing have of the food they gave us a chicken sandwich with no chicken instead they had put a beef patty in it and one of the drinks was messed up in the second floor the air conditioning didn t work it was so hot in there plus employees were just standing there not doing nothing and just ignoring the mess that was there it had poor service I do not recommend very clogged and slow service too
-1,BE CAREFUL WITH THEIR CARS STEAL if you park it for min They break the glass because they know that MANY TOURISTS visit it You will NEVER get your belongings back because not even the police are interested in solving the robbery ME BEING YOU I WOULD NEVER GO 
-1,I ordered the chicken sandwich and it had a fish taste Hopefully cooked in oil previously used for fish verse going bad Also dried out threw most of it way Soda was 
-1,If I could give a star I would My son I ordered a pizza each The server brought out but only handed my son his I commented that we ordered she had on the tray but still walked away telling minute as she walked away w the other pizza walking around the entire place including going upstairs I m sure they wouldn t put separate customers orders on the same tray After minutes I went up to the counter to ask where my pizza was as I see a different employee walking past me w a pizza without a cover I turn to see where she was heading it was to where my son was sitting I adked her why the cover was off she couldn t answer To top it all off there was hair under one of my pieces of pizz Shouldn t employees be wearing hairnets or have their hair tightly up not hanging down I m very disappointed w this being my st time here 
-1,Absolutely manic busy The food was usually McDonald s fare however chips were cold The place seems really disorganised and half the self service kiosks were out of order I wondered if this was to help the kitchen keep up Homeless people coming in and raiding tables with food left Not a pleasant experience at all and one of the worst McDonald s I have ever visited needs security guards I feel
-1,Gets jammed packed with tourist If you order on the app to pickup in store instead of thru the drive thru and decide to go inside they make you get in line for counter pickup which takes even longer Parking lot gets full with no place to park I suggest you go to a different location if you want to order and eat and park All in one place Terrible experience
-1,I can honestly say this is the world s worst McDonald s I have so far experienced A minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order I ve eaten in McDonald s all over the world and the food quality and service let this one down severely So many people were angry with ridiculous waiting times wrong orders crushed food and items not available I do not recommend it 
-1,Went through the drive through barely said our first item and was told to hold on and she just disappeared for over minutes We were being honked at by people thinking we were holding up the line I asked for a flat white in the UK that s what McDonald s calls a regular white coffee she very rudely said no you can go to Starbucks for that When we did receive our order the big Mac s were replaced with basic cheeseburgers I definitely won t bother next time we are in Orlando 
-1,Very slow service took over an hour food came out separately so my food was cold by the time the rest arrived Staff didn t seem to care Food when it arrived was not as requested but was too exhausted to bother complaining any more 
-1,Just don t go food was really bad even though it a mcDonalds Tried it out 
-1,Supposedly they do close for their staff to take a break and are not hours Maybe they should hire more staff or pay a decent wage Not like they can 
-1,Visited today Play place was out of service Dine in service was not available Some of the menu items we wanted were not available Ordered food from the machine but a staff member said he couldn t find it in the system started to retype it in the cashier Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes When I asked what was going on he started making rude comments and asked if I spoke English I asked for the refund and the worker refunded me less Then the manager came and fixed the refund error The manager was calm but didn t offer any apology The saddest part is this is a flagship McDonalds location advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere but it was a huge disappointment I wish next time I visit if ever to see working services friendly and competent staff and adequate food selection Peace 
-1,The workers over there aren t very smart I called at am to ask what time did they stop serving breakfast he stated that they served breakfast all day over the phone My reply was okay well what time do you all stop serving breakfast through the drive thru his reply we stopped serving breakfast and then I was abruptly hung up 
-1,For being on of the biggest McDonalds in the heart of orlando they need more staff It took them about mins drive through for a PC nugget and fries The worker also had an attitude that I didn 
-1,The worst McDonald

-1,This mcdonald s is the worst I ve ever been to poor parking available the staff that work there cant get the orders right and we waited mins for a mcflurry that we never got Overall experience was very disappointing considering we have come from the UK 
-1,Waited more min for my food I understand when is full is gonna take longer to prepare the food but after min paased I asked them about my order and no knew about it and ignored me I asked another lady staff mention they already made it I don t like to bash but this one was bad service
-1,The crispy chicken sandwich was Terrible dry and hard Employees 
-1,Nastiest play land games were broke but still took your money no employees anywhere to be found in game room Couldn t cash out tickets won with no one in game room or at ticket redemption counter Pizza was poor quality and over cooked Don t be sold on the hype of worlds largest McDonald s Stay away
-1,Every time info through the drive thru I get a snotty kid who doesn t even know how to listen correctly to an order I mean how frustrating is it to get an orde
-1,For this to be the biggest mcdonald s in florida they were out of a lot of things the lines were all over the place the food is more expensive and a couple of the kiosk were down We ended up leaving without any food and went to another mcdonald s Lol not what I expected at all Terrible
-1,Slowest McDonald s I ve ever been to and I ve been to many Waiting for almost an hour for your food is NOT fast food The staff didn t care There were massive queues of very unhappy customers Even though it was supposed to be a hour breakfast place there were no breakfast items available at all Some of the food was inedible and or cold I ll never return to this McDonald s 
-1,Ok so here s the deal we sat upstairs they brought us our food with no cups and no fork no butter and no syrup for babies pancakes and also forgot a bacon bagle when we told them they said they were out of bagles because it was no lunch refused to make another to correct there mistake rude with a bad attitude I am talking about min after and we spent there NEVER again we were on vacation so this is the memory our kids have of the largest McDonalds in the country 
-1,We went to this McDonald s and ordered the pasta with ravioli noodles and bolognese sauce Mind you it was good when I was eating it and when I got home after like mins i starte
-1,Just told there is absolutely nothing on the menu that s gluten free Reminds me of when I used to go in restaurants years ago Very ignorant to a common allergy these days
-1,Busy dirty badly organised expensive no vegetarian options They are capitalising on the biggest thing but it is not worth a visit No vegetarian options Self service machine not working no receipts card machine not working I could go on Edit I will go on the ketchup had run out the lemonade syrup had run out the food took over minutes there was a cup of coffee spilt on the stairs with safety cones that was not cleared up for the hour we were there 
-1,Ordered hamburgers ketchup only in the drive thru Had to park and go in the store to take the order back times to get it right took minutes total and in the process got attitude 
-1,Worst service ever mins for a cheese pizza on a fast food My mistake trying out a pizza on a burger place all hype biggest mcdonald never gonna go eat in this location again And yeah pizza tasted awful 
-1,Overheard a lot of uncertainty in the kitchen And I was knocking on the window for about minutes or more just to get the sauce I ordered It was completely unresponsive 
-1,I Had A Bad Experience Today My Family Food Was Late For Around Hours From pm to Maybe Wasn t My Lucky Day I love This Place I ve been there before and I spent a Nice Time I don t Know What Happened Costumer Service Tried To Solve the Situation But They couldn t all Costumers Were Angry At the end I Had to carry up my order incomplete home 
-1,I hate to even give this star as this was the WORST McD s visit ever Waited mins for kids meals and burger meals Didn t get my drink rcv d a plain patty in a bun when i ordered a qtr pounder with CHEESE meal no sauce for nuggets despite it being printed on my receipt which sauces I d ordered Got a halfa s effort shamrock mcflurry instead of the shamrock shake I ordered A manager was rude and yelling at every customer to move out of the way The employees weren t friendly and ignored my kiosk help request Just everyone I had to interact with was incredibly grumpy 
-1,If I could give zero stars I would We drove minutes thinking the kids would get to enjoy the play area but it was closed We even made multiple calls to the location before going to ask if the play area was open but nobody ever answered the phone We only found out after ordering and paying for food No signs and no indication on their website the play area is closed The video game card advertisement is deceptive and gave our kids credits instead of minutes leaving the done after only two games The first employee had no desire to fix the problem It wasn t till my wife finally complained to the manager Oh and if you 
-1,Believe me when I say I love McDonald s but this particular restaurant is truly dreadful Waited minutes for my first and very probably last spicy chicken sandwich photo attached You d think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small way but no They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in there Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche bun I ate it for reasons I was hungry I didn t want to wait a further minutes to be served up another sad burnt offering and the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just couldn t face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal hells Take my advice if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this restaurant order the pasta not a burger it s pretty decent if you have at least minutes to wait for it Otherwise do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of iDrive Wish I had 
-1,It was crazy We waited so long to order Cashier had to get manager to change a every time a customer gave to her people are on vacation families orders cost She had to get manager to over ride coupons Then she left register to help feel orders Unfortunately people were leaving several saying that s why chic Fila number mcdonalds should hire their trainers
-1,Do not come here It is not worth it The food never comes out hot or fresh the employees are extremely rude and the wait times are extremely long regardless of the time of day 
-1,Totally not worth it I ve received better service and food at standard McDonald s locations The prices are ridiculously high for a McDonald s the people are ghetto and the facility could have been a lot cleaner 
-1,It s a great place if you want to wait an hour for your food
-1,Worst McDonald s experience EVER Waited over an hour for food which was cold when it finally arrived Had to go back to the line to get our shake and a sundae While waiting for those talked to multiple others who had also waited over an hour for food and one who waited over minutes for coffee he aske
-1,The indoor playground was close on a saturday So many families complaining that they traveled to bring their kids here 
-1,The low score is for the Maroon Shirt Manager on who took the phone off the hook and still allowed the app to sell curbside orders that would never be delivered due to the phone being off the hook Then making people sit in the lobby and ignore them while she sat and responded to surveys Well ma am here is one for you since apparently surveys take president over service It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for hours apologizing correcting issues and holding people accountable to get anything going To her I am sorry that this is a low scoring survey She deserves better than that 
-1,The WORST We use drive thru curbside pickup because we have busy lives We ve sat at both for over min When the manager Nathan picked up the phone he sounded upset because I was calling He said he would look into my order because he was currently busy getting orders
-1, minutes late opening employees laughing while there is a line Gate is closed inside employee said to just wait I m trying to run my own business and these are notes I will take into not 
-1,Got wrong order twice Day missing a Double Cheeseburger went in to tell them and was ignored until they saw I wasn t leaving Next day ordered a Sausage McGriddle drive thru and got a Sausage and Egg McMuffin How hard is it to get a simple order right Seriously 
-1,if I could give stars I would just off this experience I had tonight I m usually not your typical Karen but when you mess up the same order times in the same night practically in the same hour i will be a Karen So first off I came all the way from boerne because this is the closest Mc Donald s too us so we get there order our food I ordered piece nuggets med fry large fry and a quarter ponder and happy meal we get our food and sadly we don t bother to check the bag we get all the way back to our house IN BOERNE we only have our quarter ponder and happy meal and the fry with the quarter ponder meal I call the McDonald s and tell them what went wrong the lady tells me sbelief 
-1,ordered a double quarter pounder and received a big mac there was hardly any line for drive thru Yet they can t get the order right 
-1,Good lord these people can t McDonald s 
-1,If I could leave stars I would I have checked in on app and called the store just like they asked twice and I ve been waiting mins for burger and a sprite At mins they answer and say they are almost ready for it and still waiting I get workers are short and I also get waits but at least hav
-1,I don t know what it is about this particular McDonald s The line is always extremely long and takes forever to get through It s been that way for years and the other day I went through for the st time in years and had the exact same result since I lived in the neighborhood adjacent to this McDonald s Nothing has changed in years that has to bad thing right 
-1,I ve been to this McDonald s twice now and it s never been faster than minutes Even with a simple order like fries and a drink Ordered mobile and it took over minutes for my order and I watched everyone standing in line to order get ignored for minutes at a time Which after reading reviews seems like it is the norm to wait minutes for a single mcgriddle After I waited over minutes for my order they forgot my drinks which I waited at the counter for another minutes before anyone even asked what I needed and my order was wrong But I wasn t about to sit another half hour for them to remake a different sandwich Not a big deal Not the employees fault necessarily just seems like they re EXTREMELY understaffed Shame on upper management for allowing this to happen I wouldn t want to work in that environment either 
-1,Ordered curbside to go sat in spot for min and never received my food Had to take my sleeping child inside Food was prepared but never brought to the car by the time i got home it was all cold Do not recommended this location 
-1,Mobile ordered food and waiting about minutes before going in and asking The young man who helped me was very nice but the other man who was working the counter was AWFUL He called a mans order once and while said man was getting up to go to the counter the worker said Oh Not here This is trash then And threw the order away It had net even been seconds since he called out the order When the young man who was working on my order stepped away to grab something the man grabbed my bag and asked what it was and why it was sitting there and started to throw it away Luckily the one helping me stoped him and finished my order While I understand they were busy but that is no way to act This is by far the worst experience I ve ever had at this location Thinking it But today I will never order here again and will be in contacting corporate about their behavior After minutes of waiting I go inside and ask for my food and a refund They argued with me that I hadn t ordered when you can see of the app the exact time my order was placed My food was sitting on the counter to be taken out Instead of giving me my food the girl 
-1,Long wait at drive thru despite one car in front of me minutes to get a fish sandwich and drink Sandwich was disgusting and wound up throwing it Out Staff seemed confused as my order sat on the counter with workers waking past it many times before they finally gave it to me 
-1,There s no one in line when I go and they can t even put jelly in my bag as requested So many regulations to using the mobile app code that it 
-1,If I could put no starts I would First off the girl working the drive through got our order wrong So then when we pulled up to the second window the boy was giving us a ton of attitude We get our food and the fries are burnt and old and there s no salt on them so they taste old and bland 
-1,Working for doordash in that area and everytime I go to pick up a order I wait over minutes atleast People are just standing around and doing nothing I even asked who the manager is and the lady pointed to the guy sitting down eating This hasn t just happened once it has happened every time I don t like to accept orders from McDonald because of this but I have to make money This place needs to get their stuff in gear It s a busy place and not really any competition 
-1,Worst McDonald s I ve ever been too The disrespectful teenager that brought my food to my car was slow and never spoke a word 
-1,Drive to the next McDonald s This place is robbing people French fries are ALWAYS old and cold There will be something missing or wrong with your order of the time They served me old expired pies I m convinced there is no management and the owners do not keep track of what s going on in their own restaurant Once they have messed up your order there 
-1,There is no way to rate your establishment very disheartening due to we were on the road and needed to sit and rest before getting back on also need to use the restroom Food was great but can t really give proper rating cause of this I enjoy McDonald s but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere Please do not reply due to pandemic and safety due to other establishment being open I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonald s due to this I stop because of the Kids Disheartening once again 
-1,Lobby still closed even though Whataburger and everyone else has opened up So you get to spend to minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up Happened again today A simple meal with a coke Got only the Big Mac and nothing else Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back She disappeared for few minutes and when she returned with my order shoved it at me and rudely turned away like it was all my fault This is probably the worst run McDonald s in the area Don t recommend it at all 
-1,Don t ever try ordering online for pickup here If you do you had better bring the device you ordered on They don t care If that s a phone tablet or desktop computer they expect it to be here before they will release the food to you My wife ordered pur food so that she didn t have to relay everyone s orders over the phone to me Got to the restaurant and they literally wanted me to drive home and get my wife s phone for security reasons They also took no responsibility saying it s our falt for not being normal and brining the device like everone else and wouldn t offer any solutions We ended up canceling the order and going to Chick fil A who by the way my wife ordered online and they let me pick up without needing the device I called corporate and they said in this situation the staff at this location should have just asked for the order number and brought me the order 
-1,Horrible experience First the person taking order sounded rushed I barely mention my first item and you just constantly get What else what else what else before I m even done talking Second I asked for my fries to be WELL DONE I got nasty undercooked fries Either that or they were old fries I get to the window and present a coupon for a discount The guy looks for the numbers instead of just scanning the QR Code pops his head back out the window and tell me the same total What happened with the coupon Did it not take Hi
-1,I had revise my earlier review left underneath this new one Just had the most bizarre experience The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back She FOLLOWED me to the other window and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink As I had just given her my money she shouldn t be handling my food at all much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger She then closed the window and started throwing a coniption that I couldn t hear The then reopened the windows stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered I told her I didn t understand and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again closer and more loudly I don t get it I ve been here many times and gotten my food without any problems This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change Great they have really turned things around in the last couple years The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent These days despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonald s Standard fast food with correct orders Not sure if they got new management training or equipment but these guys have brought back the Gold Arch Standard Great job team 
-1,I previously had great service with the last McDonald s leadership team They were prompt and efficient This current team lacks the standards of the previous one Car lines were backup and missing items ordered in the bag over minutes for a hot apple pie unacceptable I thoug
-1,Online says they open at am but staff showing up late and didn 
-1,Been understaffed for over a month You expect McDonald s to be there for your midnight cravings I remember a group of people were told that McDonald s was not taking their order due to being understaffed yet there were people in the back It only takes people to run things back there What do you do during the day when you re understaffed Lose out on the incoming money If people cant function in the back then you shouldn t be working there to begin with Simple as that 
-1,Horrible experience There was a long line for the drive thru so I pulled out of line thinking that a curbside order would be faster After minutes I keep seeing employees come in and out but not bringing food to the curbside orders and the line for the drive thru kept moving Even the car that pulled next to me gestured for me what is going on I called the number on the sign and no one answered I hung up and called again because at this point I was upset and couldn t cancel my order through the app Finally someone answered and I told I had been waiting minutes at this point for my food to come out and I was to cancel my order She said that I had to do it on the app I told her no I already tried and I need the manager to refund me my money She said she was the manager and I had to cancel on the app I asked her how do you do it because I didn nl be out soon with my refund An employee comes out to deliver the car next to me their order I then had to shout over to him where my refund is and he said they were still working on it Horrible customer service Now I 
-1,It always takes forever to get somebody to help you 
-1,Pure trash Worst experience on multiple occasions Card swiped and charged twice Took and act of Congress to get it reversed Paid at the first window drove to the second window and employee says You didn t pay for your food Show the receipt and no apology or remorse just oh Hands food to me Last episode shortchanged of a Bill GM says next we checked everything except what was actually take from the register and denies error in the transaction but say I ll give you a free meal and dessert I can t wait to see that location shut down for good Shame on the franchise owner and the corporation for the service at that location Filing a police report and BBB complaint 
-1,The service is incredibly slow and the staff clearly couldn t care less about customer service Cashier smelt like a fresh ash tray Make sure you check your bag before driving off I know it s fast food but they could have some standards
-1,Worst McDonald s ever Sorry I usually love all McDonald s 
-1,Dining room is closed and the drive thru line is always long Ordering on the app for curbside took over minutes to get our food brought out to us I would recommend waiting out the drive thru if you must have McDonalds
-1,There were only people ahead of us in the order line It took minutes before we could order It took another minutes for our food to come We were missing parts of our order and everything we ordered was cold McDonald s corporate needs to visit this location and review service cleanliness and food product 
-1,Ordered their all day breakfast around pm after work and had hash browns and a sausage biscuit The biscuit was so hard that I could not bite through it and I even made a hole in the top when I was just trying to bend it to see if it would move and obviously it was very old I was inside so I took it back and asked for a new one and I even apologized for causing them trouble I waited about minutes and when they brought what was supposed to be a new one out to me it was the same one It was smashed so they had probably tried to see if I was lying about the texture and smashed it when they saw how hard it was They had reheated it and gave it back to me with the hole on the top biscion to not do so Imagine what they are giving you 
-1,It s McDonald s I never expect anything to much But I do expect the servers to be nice to customers and each other But sadly that is not true at this location My server showed no interest or seemed not to care that he has to work Sadly this is not the first time I experienced this type of service from this location If you want a quick lunch snack or dinner It is worth the drive to go to the Rim location At least the servers say hi and are friendly 
-1,Check your order We live nearby and so it s very convenient Unfortunately we can t rely on them getting the order correct and it s not worth the hassle of going back in and waiting for the thing they forgot Once we got a Happy Meal with no nuggets next time it was a combo with no fries and then a combo with no burger We re done Not worth the hassle This isn t a McDonald s issue it s just this location 
-1,This location refuses to serve truck drivers Tried to walk through the drive thru but was told that they couldn t serve me if I wasn t in a car Sounds like discrimination against oversized vehicles to me If they can get sued for burning someone with hot coffee you better believe ill have a suit filed before Monday 
-1,The McDonald s at Fair Oaks has got to be the slowest location with the rudest people Seriously there are two other locations in either direction at the Rim and in Boerne so go to one of those unless you love to wait forever for sub par lukewarm food and or be slapped around with someone s bad attitude 
-1,Tried their new Crispy Chicken sandwich Came wirh pickles only no mayo or any other condiments And the guy on the intercom couldn t talk articultely i e as if he was on drugs or half asleep 
-1,Went through the drive through and at am was told only serving breakfast and that I d have to circle back around to the back of the line since lunch doesn t start until am 
-1,Food tastes gross been eating healthy too long figured I would try them out it has been probably years since I had McDonald s chicken products It was either old or they figured out how to Nuke girl Chicken in about seconds either way slightly concerning LOL this is only a review of the food quality the service at this location seem great and if we could rate businesses categorically then they would have received five stars for customer service and speed
-1,Update If I could give this location zero stars I would I have given them multiple chances and every time it just gets worse Do not mobile order and expect it to be timely nor correct Do not expect any friendly customer service here from anyone including the managers They all need a lesson in management and customer service 
-1,Ordered food at got there at put my parking number into the app made sure it was the right location waited minutes No food went in mad because I ve been waiting they tell me that my order was never in the system I showed them the app showing that it was this location and that the order was placed I placed an online order yesterday and with th
-1,Manager was very rude and unprofessional staff was disrupted by her disrespect for customers She was in too much of a rush to speed cars along that i was unable to purchase more food Bad business practice in my opinion DT am Thursday June 
-1,You all need to step up the game My order is almost always wrong especially the kids meals for some reason just like today I asked for apples and of course didn t get them Shocker Girl at the st window in a camo jacket was rude and generally unhappy sounding Terrible Update we ALSO got a toy in the happy meal with a coupon for a ticket to six flags that expired in 
-1,This is the rd time in a month that we have ordered food from this store and have not received even close to what we have ordered Would avoid this location at all cost from here on out Continually going down hill and poor and slow service 
-1,Friday night pm Dining room still closed There are about cars in line behind the person who just ordered when an employee comes out and tells us SORRY WE STOPPED TAKING ORDERS BECAUSE WE CLOSE AT 
-1,Just trash service just waited minutes in a drive thru after paying just walk in and grab my own food and barely get a im sorry they tried to bring me the wrong order took my receipt and NEVER came back I walked in to get my own food Absolute worst experience ordering food in a drive thru NEVER AGAIN
-1,Why would you ask me when im ordering if i want any condiment if ur just going to forget them Fries are raw and my sandwich patty was hard but yet they still some how managed to smush the sandwich in half Atlest they wore able to get the drink right 
-1,This McDonalds is a hot mess I live near it and regret coming here every time I do Always out of something or a machine is down Tonight I sat in the drive through for min just sitting here watch the drive thru guy freak out over his computer not working only to be told a machine is out Get it together 
-1,Not only does this location routinely forget items we paid for tonight they served us a RAW burger and also forgot food and I 
-1,Just had the worst meal Fries were limp and very cold Chicken nuggets tasted like cardboard my kids wouldn t even eat them The lettuce on my chicken sandwich was unrecognizable and brown Utterly disgusted doesn t even cover it 
-1,Not to be mean but I d say this is Probably up there with one of the top worst McDonald s I ve gone to and I find that funny because it s a McDonald s my standards really are not that high I 
-1,I like the food here but I can not stand that manager Franklin I ve gotten a degree in psychology and he displays so many abusive traits He was so badgering to a few of his workers Also a male and female worker were hugging and being unprofessional I could only read the female s name tag and it was Stacy Please be careful with who you promote as manager I won t come back unless I hear about a change in management 
-1,The staff was slow getting orders out that were taken in the lobby and they got at least people s orders wrong while I was there waiting for my breakfast combo for literally minutes
-1,Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size tax that was only filled half way I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now They wouldn t even pass the edge of the front part When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window Very rude employees
-1,I get about half a box of fries every time i go Its really frustrating how stingy they can be with french fries I order a large and get less than a small Also I m very upset with the price changes of already overpriced trash 
-1,Just left was hu gry got home and my quarter pounder is raw The nuggets were old and cold really Had to just throw out and make a sandwich My year old wasn t happy she wants all week for her nuggets She gets a piece and shares the bpiece with me 
-1,It doesn t seem to matter what time of the day you go here it is always going to be a minute wait to get your food and that is after you have ordered It s another minutes to wait to order It seems that they focus solely on the drive thru versus the counter 
-1,Was not very impressed with this location service was awful people in line ahead of me wife used restroom took my place in line I used the restroom came back waited close to ten more minutes for our order to be taken mind you only three customers we ordered two piece nuggets fry s and drinks CHECK YOUR ORDERS HERE We got a fish sandwich fry and a big mc ours was not only order messed up they had perfect scores for wrong then when we dig get the nuggets they were still frozen inside and had to take them back staff just want to draw a paycheck but not do anything and have how dare you attitude when you bring things to their attention never did get my food finally had enough and walked out I will make this 
-1,When I was there a manager named Franklin was very unhelpful and rude and I wish I could just give him stars He was even humiliating his workers As a person of virtue I can not allow this to go unnoticed All other services was ok but it was just the manager who was the problem at this establishment 
-1,Stop Abort Do not drive thru No lie we got there and there was a line One car at the speaker another car and then us Many cars came after us minutes we got to the speaker We were trapped in line By that time one of us went inside placed our order and came back just after we reached the speaker We were seriously going to go over the curb thru the lava rocks and leave when the cars behind us started backing out Not even exaggerating There were cars behind us in front of us Never has a McDonalds been this slow 
-1,I have been here a handful of times as I live in the area every single time the food is old and cold Drive to the RIM if you have time I keep trying again bc the location is convenient but never again I will say the servers are very nice but what you 
-1,I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal the fries were good but I took one bit out of the burger only to discover the patties were not fully cooked

-1,They redesigned the inside and it s Extremely Loud and noisy because the children s area is wide open to the area where adults would be sitting and you can t even hear the TV s it s so loud from the kids I will not be eating inside of this McDonald s ever again Also felt PUSHED to use a Kiosk instead of the girls at the COUNTER why have ANYBODY UP FRONT IF US AARP PPL can t use their services Never again

-1,Just to preface I m not a McDonald s regular so I don t know what the norm is for this location I placed a mobile order and when I came to pick up it disappeared into the backroom chaos About minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers I figured I d just hang out and just check in every once in a while since I had nothing pressing to do Dozens of orders went through while I was there Most of them went through slowly and a LOT needed substitutions since many products weren t available The store s CO went down so they couldn t give out soda Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda shakes being subbed for ice cream lemonades being subbed for tea They were trying with what they had but what an absolute madhouse Listening to the regulars in line it sounds like this has been common recently This exercise of curiosity went on so long an hour that there seemed to be a shift change Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order Apparently mobiles don t process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee which didn t happen the previous times I asked Because of this I m sure that this doesn t reflect in their service metrics at all The employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like or like you see on your paper receipts However that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering rather than the local store After they figured it out it took maybe seconds to get my food Super weird experience 
-1,Good morning Please tell me if this matters or if I m being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned Maybe because I didn t have my coffee this morning I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning This morning I forgot my wallet I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than breakfast tomorrow They said so sorry No I pleaded with this new manager that I d never seen before I asked for the manager that I d spoken with on several occasions She refused to see me and he stated that her response would be the same I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us He said it would be discarded Seriously I asked So I said that you d rather throw it away then let me have it a faithful customer So my lesson is now Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson McDonalds doesn t care about my patronizing their establishment and I m going to seriously break my coffee habit No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me A lesson well learned can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded

-1,I just stopped at this McDonald s for a small Carmel frappe with extra Carmel and a blueberry muffin There was no cars in the drive thru The young lady asked if I could please moved to the next window I get there and sat for a little while no one came to the window I went to the next window there was a woman standing there I said good morning and tried handing her cash She says we don t take money here pointing to the Window behind me and walked away from the window EXTREMELY RUDE I said umm excuse me Ma am She never came back to the Window Instead someone by the name of Jasmine Ramirez comes to the window instead and insist that I drive BACK to the first window because the employee w my money How is it my fault that your employee wasn t at the window When another car approached the drive through Jasmine then asked what did u order I explained my order and she says we don t have Carmel frappes I then ask woww why wouldn t she the employee mention that She apologized and said the employee just got here she didn t know more ex
-1,They have a problem with people soliciting and asking for money Had a guy with just ripped pants inside No shirt or shoes who approached me and started to size me up IN THE MCDONALDS Always busy and never a quiet moment Owner of this franchise needs to actually enforce their solicitation policy before I ever try to come back

-1,Please avoid this location at all costs Not all the employees are wearing masks gloves not even hairnets While in line at the drive through I watched as they handed bags to cars the drivers checked them out gave it back wrong order Then it happened again I was able to see the staff member put the she retrieved from previous customer to the side When I got to the window for my pickup she wanted me to take that bag When I said no ask to get the order redone she wanted to debate this issue I finally asked for a refund When food goes out of their possession and comes back from a customer it s spoiled should be thrown out industry standards especially in today s environment No one here cares about safety I 
-1,If you want your order wrong this is the place for you I ve been here at least time s and almost every time the order is wrong

-1,This place is the worst and we come here twice a day and don t know why I always get our food wrong every time no matter what The people running the speaker and the drive thru menu do not know the product nor the day engage correctly with correct language Not only do they not give me two extra milks today but they also spilled coffee on me in the Drive Thru Not coming back

-1,I thought It would be nice to stop at McDonald s because I dint want to cook today place my order the young lady that took my payment was nice and friendly but the person that was handing the food out had an attitude problem I asked for a cup holder and she looked at me like I stole something and when she handed my food to me she act like I was disturbing her so I will not go back to that McDonalds no more west Madison Street in oak Park I m sorry her day going bed but you chose to work there I did not force you to work though that s the career path you chose and my fries are cold and old dint want to drive ba CV k lesson learned they lost a customer
-1,Too many flies in the kitchen Poor food and a sloppy looking man who supposedly managed Did not notice filthy cup handed to me for drink An awesome employee noticed and gave me clean cup Dirty restaurant poor management great woman supervisor 
-1,The bacon cheese fries were cold and there was just a bit of cheese sauce on top leaving the bottom fries dry and hard My daughter purchased a Dr Pepper that taste like carbonated water with just a bit of aftertaste We went through the drive thru and it was very busy so wet just ended up tossing most of it

-1,I used to work here Last Wednesday I ordered an unsweetened tea no ice When I got home there was ice in it but I let it slide This time I ordered the same thing but this time it s a sweetened tea I mean the short time I worked there I was in the drive through window taking orders since I was the most efficient there out of everyone and had the most enthusiasm These last trips have been misfires compared to past trips Note that I go through the drive through after pm when it s not busy at all so there s no reason to mess up an order with items or less

-1,It took very long to get the food and they also didn t even know what most of the McDonald s app was 
-1,Would give it less stars if I could I purchased my meals via the McDonald s app in order to save some time when I arrived and pulled into curbside parking slot and entered it into the app I received the message that this store is currently closed which it was not So I had to wait in the drive thru lane almost minutes only to have the cashier charge my account twice then had to wait roughly another minutes for the manager to appear only to tell me there is nothing she can do about it and I would have to contact the app department 
-1,Teach your employees basic math I m relying on delivery services because of the COVID outbreak closing everything Unfortunately that means I m stuck with what I get I ordered hashbrowns and received Did you know that means there are more hash browns than Amazing fact isn t it It s something you should ve learned in pre school On top of that they gave me no receipt I have no proof of this Maybe it s in your computer but I demand a refund since I can t get one with the delivery app and maybe pick up the phone as I was calling this McDonald s about this over and over Thank you

-1,Terrible
-1,We waited minutes for our mobile order till we went up to a worker and told her we had a mobile order She walked away without even saying anything and came right back out with our food which was probably just sitting aside the whole time The fries are old I even took a picture to show I understand dine in is closed but at least be consistent with your mobile orders and kindness goes a long way she needs more training 
-1,I repeated my order numerous time and he repeated Get to the window and review the order and it was wrong The employee was debating the order and ask to speak to a manager And to my findings it was another employee that did the same debate I ask numerous time if he was supervisor or manager and he said yes False Ask for corporate number and dumv found Was asked to pull forward and they wound bring out my order Four cars passed and I walked onto the store and a white female dressed in store uniform appeared after a wait period to give me the order In the car open order Fries old and burger burnt Just sad The order was trashed 
-1, cars in line no one taking orders went to the first window and she said she couldn t take my order to go to the next the next window had a huge attitude and got smart with me saying she can t take my order either and don t know why the first window told me that So I asked where I should order and she said not here and when I asked her again she said to come in the lobby So I drive around and tried but the doors were locked so I went back to the window again and she took my order and then I get home to find the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered is just bread pickles and sauce No chicken Don t even want to waste my time going back Last time I ordered it I got a spicy mcchicken which is also wrong Learn the menu care about your customers I will not be returning to this location 
-1,I order my food ahead of time online Only to get there minutes later and it s not even ready The large fry I ordered was of the way full there was absolutely no ice in my drink which was a lemonade and tea so it s not like it was cold like the sodas come out of the machine and they were practically shoving me out the door when I asked for ketchup and salt By far one of the worst customer service experiences I ve had
-1,Disgusting I felt a nasty Baby roach In my bag of food This is an outrage And this place should be shut down Try to get it resolved by manager And just complete disbelief Of the manners this woman had Infested With roaches sick poor service Disgusting establishment 
-1,There s a reason why there s mainly stars and one star reviews for this McDonald s I will say about of the time it s good and then the other half is horrible One time I went before breakfast ended And place my order Got to the first window to pay for the order and then when I got to the window to pick up my order they told me they couldn t do breakfast anymore Another time I went inside around pm and despite the door being open and plenty of employees chatting and talking instead of working they said they were drive thru only currently Another time the line wasn t that long but took a good minutes to get through and when I got to the window to pick up my order they had more employees inside talking and chatting There s been a few times some lady taking the order wasn t friendly and kept rushing orders by asking anything else I will say though that the food has almost always been hot and correctly ordered that is the only good thing about this location 
-1,After decades of serving families McDonald s is on their way out I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs McDonald s needs individuals who can read comprehend and speak English Today I went there for lunch I ordered Filet o Fish sandwich meal I ended up with peice chicken nuggets Hmmmm I guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet o Fish sandwich I quickly caught the error and told the cashier She said So you don t want it Then the manager came along to find out what the problem was I explained and received the sandwich I left and when I got home I found out I had a frosted breakfast pastry in a Filet o Fish box Come on now McD s May we get better service and expect a lot more from you If not please close your doors to save the public from the irritation 
-1,This place is always awfully busy and slow Not their fault But we are very unsatisfied with the treatment received at the drive thru the other day You don t call out your clientele for whatever reason especially not in such a blunt rude fashion If Ra
-1,Drove up to lane to place order Waited to be acknowledged vehicles drove up to lane while I continued to wait and placed their orders before me I pulled ahead to the window never being acknowledged at drive thru speaker When I pulled to the window I stated that I was never acknowledged and didn t get to place my order I was told that I could not place an order at the window and to go back through the drive thru I chose to go to another location I submitted a formal complaint about their policy through their app Be prepared for drive thru customer service inconsistency if you go to this location 
-1,Second time I ve been to this location and the second time was even worse than the first The fries were so soggy the box was getting flimsy from the excess oil I couldn t even eat them The cashier was complaining about having to refund me my milkshake because apparently they didn t have milkshakes My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and the chicken was visibly burnt 
-1,My Mc Nuggets where burnt after a minute wait and i was told to wait in the speaker i recommend going to E Anderson Ln
-1,This was by far the worst experience I ve had a McDonalds drive through There were only a few cars in line but I waited minutes to get to the order station and another to get to the window to pay and get my food I can t imagine what they were doing in there that it took so long 
-1,Consistently the SLOOOWEST McDonalds I have ever seen Also their prices are higher than all of the other McDonalds in Austin for some reason To top it off the food is usually cold and they have a hard time even understanding your order 
-1,What can I say it s McDonalds The food is never cold or smashed It s hit or miss on the type of employee you ll get at the drive through They either don t want to be here and hate the fact that you re making them work or they smile and make you feel welcomed It s close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch I m editing my last post and changing my rating I waited in the Drive Thru for minutes with no one coming on the line The other line however three cars went through while I sat there I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around The level of unacceptable is insane I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake The day is Monday June th at pm The morning crew is a good bunch of workers however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow 
-1,Wow this McDonald s Is the worst ran one that I ve been to in Texas Food is consistently delivered wrong Your bag is going to always have a missing item Can we go back in to get your missing items is such a hassle that you just keep on driving home without turning around because it s not going to be with your while
-1,We waited min in the drive thru line to be told we had to come inside for our mobile drive thru order The guy in the drive thru insisted we go inside to pick up the order We parked in front I went inside and waited mins to be asked what my order was The cashier said she didn t have a order for my code I was giving her She went over to the drive thru cashier and she told him he needs to process the mobile orders in the drive thru It was causing a delay with several customers
-1,Terrible Used to be okay Come here all the time and have seen its decline Horrible wait times order mistakes always out of lettuce always out of drinks Needs new management or more workers

-1,If I can give this place ZERO stars I would I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for minutes or Longer So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line Food wasn t warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt Never coming to this place again if your near by this location I recommend going to the McDonald s on by Taco Bell

-1,I ordered oatmeal and received a cup of cream When I call the person who identified themself as the Manger hung up on me

-1,This is hands down without argument the worse McDonald s in America do not waste your time go somewhere else Literally just a drive thru is open and they still have to stop for to minutes to get there s back together numerous times have I been in the Drive Thru and had to wait minutes plus for these stupid MFrs to figure out how to do their job correctly You just need to close down this location and let a fast food company that knows what they re doing take over it There is another McDonald s less than three minutes from this McDonald s I highly encourage you to go to that one
-1,Go to the McDonald s in Capital plaza because the one off of always has still fries and their food just ain t good TheyMac rib wasn t even warmed up all the way I ll never go to that McDonald s every in my life

-1,bad service and very dirty inside 
-1,Horrible drive through takes mins with no cars in the line
-1,This is by far the most unprofessional location I have ever had the displeasure of visiting The staff as a whole are lazy and not at all interested in customer or service French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer Hours are mis posted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service I will gladly drive twenty miles out of my way to avoid this location in the future 
-1,Sat in the drive thru for close to minutes waiting for my order to be taken After asking twice if anyone was there and being told give me a minute I gave up and drove off 
-1,Very bad service Rude cashier Bunch of us were neardy for some Army training so we were allowed to go pick up food Consensus ended up being this place and the cashier was rude and with an attitude like she didn t even want to be therre or that we were bothering her It was at least an order for personnel maybe more Even one of my buddies was saying excuse to her times and she ignored her and when she finally turned around with that attitude again just for some sauce Jeez That streak of negative reviews explains a lot didn t even bother ordering my own food just cau
-1,This McDonalds is pretty hit or miss mostly miss I placed an online mobile order showed up minutes later and the lady kept me waiting for minutes until she told me they didnt have my order Didnt even try to accommodate me any other way she simply just turned me away Was pretty rude also They apparently couldn t be bothered to service a PAYING customer 
-1,My fries were so nasty and dark brown The lady I spoke with swears that they were fresh But I was so out done that she didn t even say bring them back and we ll correct the problem because our job is to satisfy the customer Or even take my name to replace it on my next visit But she was very argumentative Maybe next time it will be better 
-1,I would like to say that I am highly disappointed that this is my nd time getting Large sweet teas from this facility only to arrive at work and find out they taste horrible This is the convenient location on my way to work and the usual drive thru workers know my vehicle so they normally get it right but when there is someone different at the window HOW HARD IS IT TO ENTER THE RIGHT ORDER IN THE SCREEN LARGE SWEET TEAS I shouldn t have to hold up the drive thru line to taste the teas each time they give them to me Then they get an attitude when you ask for your receipt or a manager s name HORRIBLE SERVICE 
-1,I get to the drive though at pm I figure since theres not a big line it should not take long and will be back to work on time by am It s currently am and I can neither go forward or back in the drive though to get out Thanks for the write up McDs I understand it s not like it used to be and fast food isn t min fast but with an hour I can sit at a restaurant and eat and have time remaining
-1,Hated my experience going inside the cashier was flustered and kept messing up I paid for a large drink but she hands me a medium cup they were out of ice on both drink fountains and when the manager was told she already knew Then someone said we re not out they re both broken So where s the sign letting the customers know And out of all that my fries had no salt on them now y all know that s the best part of your trip to Mickey Dee s eating the hot fries smh 
-1,As the mother of an employee who is encouraging her to maintain a level of financial responsibility while attending school The level of treatment receive by African American vs Hispanic employess is very saddening What I will not encourage is for her to accept mistreatment or bei g misused by any establishment on any level She was refused breaks on more than one occasion and tonight was told to clock out after drinking water while being made to order runner and on fries I would strongly recommend that Manager s be However I am aware that there was also another manager there by the name of Irenetrained in what managing really intels O called the store and the Manager refused her name not to mention my daughter doesn t even know her name This is unacceptable on all levels and it needs to be addressed I will most certainly be reaching out to higher in command
-1,They close the lobby earlier than what is posted they got our order wrong times They make faces when we asked for the correct things They made us pay for an order of fries that should have already been included in our order It took us so long to get through that drive thru and the entire situation was a complete mess Smh 
-1,We are staying at the hotel next door My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open They are He walks over and the doors are locked Walks back to the hotel takes his car through the drive through sits for minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored He comes back to the hotel and calls again at least times each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier Finally someone answers the call he asks if they are open and they said no he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at am if it is closed they said because their job is just to answer the phone Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers My husband used to work in fast food and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true but this location makes the company look bad McDonald s should fire the franchise owner or shut this location down because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees 
-1,Even If you get there first in the drive thru everyday only a limited places to eat with my time maybe to people behind you order a simple meal you get pushed to the pick up meal area with the same to waiting for our food Just and sometimes the people behind you get their food first and they ordered more than you And by the time I get my food the fries are stale and super salty It seems like they are trying to out clear their drive thru numbers to show corporate they are clearing numbers 
-1,The manager and or the Owner does not have business sense Poor staffing for the late shift I pulled up to order some french fries at and was told it will be a minute wait and to pull to the parking lot I asked why and the person said I have to go to school in the morning He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault Bad choice of words They may need to not be a hour McDonald s Hire appropriate staff I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed And charged for a small order of fries SMH I am glad that my mood was good However I do not feel sorry for reporting them to the BBB and giving a BAD rating They need to do better or get better ownership because they McDonald s look bad 
-1,Everyone knows what they get at this McDonald s but come on now st being forced to order from the new kios not to hard but its slow and takes forever But numerous people came in after me and ordered from the front cashier and all of the orders got there food before I did Normally I wouldn t post something like this But ive been to this McDonald s times and this was my best experience yet 
-1,Longest Drive Through experience for a couplr dollar menu items Loved pulling around the front and waiting while watching more cars behind me get orders and go about their day 
-1,I ve been to this location a few times and everytime I have been the food is always old and the fries taste like they have been sitting for hours They are always out of sweet tea and coffee and it seems like nobody cares about the quality of food that is being served 
-1,The customer service is very very bad I waited there for almost minutes to be served That s not the first time I was there like that So I walked out and I went to the drive thru I was in the drive through and out of the drive thru probably in about minutes That is the worst manager I have ever seen
-1,Do you want dysentery cholera or one of the Big Then eat here otherwise you would be wise to avoid this McDonalds as if it were the plague Immediately upon walking through the door I was stunned by an extremely offensive and pungent odor It was so difficult to focus on much else due to the severity of the smell This was not a smell of hamburgers or French fries this was the smell of spilled milk that had soured and marred in the Texas heat for weeks Truly this smell is likely from the repeated spilling of soda at the drink stations that had either been overlooked or merely disregarded by careless employees Beyond the smell the sights were just as appalling There were trays with discarded food and wrappers lining the tables as well as smashed food around the floor Granted the trays are the result of lazy and inconsiderate people that believe they shouldn t be required to tend to their mess the employee s should have direction from management to conduct a lobby check at set periods to ensure this doesn t result in customer dissatisfaction All this being said I simply walked into the lobby to order a drink and I would have been on my merry way I stood at the counter and waited for one of the cashiers to acknowledge that they were ready to take my order I received numerous glances from who I assumed was the front of store worker I was the only customer in line in the lobby but understood that there was also a drive through at which customers were present I waited a bit longer received additional glances from previously said employees Still I was not asked for my order I was doing nothing that would have given the appearance that I was unready to order I was not on the phone not fiddling with my wallet I was standing quietly intently looking at multiple employees that dismissed my presence employees present managers in the back and zero orders from me This normally would not have been an issue I would have waited a bit longer but the lack of regard for cleanliness and the piercing stench that wafted throughout the lobby forced me to leave I m not likely to enter this facility nor purchase any product from this store after today If the management and workers leave the front of the store in such a state it forces me to wonder about the areas where customers cannot see To all those that dare enter ye be warned 
-1,Ice cream was gritty and the fudge they put on my daughters sundae was runny and tasted a little like coffee We trashed it before we left the parking lot Better luck next time 
-1,I ordered breakfast with no line and took minutes to tell me they didn t have that breakfast item available There were about employees not really that busy So I said ok to something equivalent in cash value Then they had an issue getting a mocha coffee out due to some poor understanding of the machine So after fifteen minutes I left my food on the counter and walked away before I started yelling at a manager I don t like to do that but just reaffirms that this particular McDonald 
-1,Surprise up charges then they blame you for it I won t return to this location again 
-1,This is how they brought me my dipped cones after making me wait for minutes pulled up from the window
-1,Awful location Staff is very rude food is almost always cold and if you need to voice anything you have to go thru the to min wait process all over again in their drive thru 
-1,For this Franchise company to be how do I put it nicely in a low income area this McDonald was way overpriced the owner speculated everyone receives unemployment Dear Owner Note to yourself NOT everyone receives unemployment and we have jobs Rethink your prices and start paying your employees better Thank you Denisia 
-1,Wow I mean wow Over employees and they all need to work on their people skills It s just so disappointing on how they attended us Restrooms were a mess it wasn t even packed and to top it off one of the employees was eating fries out of the fry tray while preparing orders I just don t know what else to say other than I will NEVER come back to this location 
-1,Usually McDonald s allows you to pay w Credit card grab your cup so you can satisfy your thrist if the staff is too busy This McDonald s I paid for a meal and went to grab my cup just I like I do days a week and the staff woman yelled at me and accused me stealing despite the proof of payment in hand They were Very ugly mean and disrespectful 
-1,I placed my order on the mobile app this morning and I waited minutes for my order to come out to the curbside and still nothing I thought this way or ordering is suppose to be faster than waiting in the long line of the drive thru I finally left since I was already late for work since they took long I called to find out what was going on and no one will answer the phone 
-1,Waited minutes in front of the register They never Acknowledged our presence there Employees and Manager we re just talking not doing anything Then the girl from the drive thru comes and takes our order I ask who s the Manager on duty she replies it s the guy in white shirt He happens to come to the counter and i told him his service here sucks He looks at me and says so what I dont care This is coming from the Manager When you first walk into this McDonald s it stinks like dirty diapers This location always stinks and customer service is very Horrible This is the only location close to my work Manager and employees are there for a paycheck only NOT customer service The Owners should do a surprise visit there 
-1,The only thing open is the drive thru I drive a large truck that will not fit in the drive thru and they will not answer the phone to place an order to pickup So tried the app they want you to order from and after minutes going through all the questions switching from screen to screen and placing my order then giving them my CC info it tells me that the location is closed I look over at the or so cars going through the drive thru getting their food and decided I really didn t want their food anyways now or in the future
-1,This place might as well close at night with how long it takes 
-1,I ordered peoples food received only one pack after immediately I called this location Walmart inside McDonald s spoke to one lady or manger I don t no who she she said want come pickup the food I said I can t come she said ok we can t give refund she talking very rudely please don t c
-1,Slow and rude The female who took my order had trouble understanding english as I repeatedly had to tell her that I didn t want a drink with my Then it took minutes to get to the window I was already late for work and sped off after another minutes I called both the store and corporate to complain Never got through to either I m not going back to any McDonalds Ever 
-1,This McDonald s is very low on service When i first walked there was a smell of something rooting or something else and it just smelled horrible Everyone that walked i would seem that The soda station had trash on it the tables weren t clean I also had to wait an extra min for my food but it was already ready but the people were just standing around not calling out my order i had to go up to them and say is that my order and the guy said i don t know 
-1,Sat at one of the drive thru station for minutes without anyone asking for our order Saw the other order station was taking orders Went inside and couldn t get anyone s attention to ask about it maybe being broken they have 
-1,Service real slow It appears that the Manager and a staff showed the customer s there open dis agreement Staff was loud Managet was the same You take all disagreement to the back not on front Seems like a racial disagreement Time pm Not Good on the manager part 
-1,This Place is Horrible The Manager JOSUE is absolutely the worst person you ll ever meet The Employees are treated wrong and he always uses a scapegoat to deal with problems I don t see why he became manager Apart from that the Place is filthy the dr
-1,The kiosks suck People can t figure out how to use them so you have to wait If you can get someone at the register they act put out I managed to skip the kiosk and had to wait longer than the people that took forever figuring out the kiosks Been here minutes and s
-1,I love how on their door they say the drive thru is open till am however between pm pm I sat there waiting for someone to respond to me at the speakerbox I didn t know they had closed their drive thru window early until a customer who was leaving let me know But I m not the type to critique without leaving advice so here s some for free This is like IQ so get ready You get a piece of paper and write something to the effect of drive thru closed and tape it to the drive thru speakerbox This will effectively let everyone except blind drivers know that no one in the store will be taking your order For blind drivers and other drivers you can just use the speakerbox to let them know 
-1,It s was all good until me and a couple of friends came into the lobby and a gentleman who looked to be Hispanic with dark hair and a dark beard was complaining to a manager about how he has already cleaned the lobby twice and doesn t wanna clean it a third time assuming we were the problem not to mention other comments that were made about us coming in and I thought that was very uncool I get coming in late but this place is 
-1,Came here at pm and this is how I got my meal 
-1,My food was overcooked The lettuce they put on my hot spicy was brown and it looked like it needed to thrown away I waited almost twenty minutes for a six dollar meal Their fountain drink machine needs to be fixed The orange hi c is just orange syrup and the sprite taste like carbonated water I wont be going back there 
-1,Went to this location this morning around am tried to order at drive thru was told I had to come in once I went in cash registers didn t work they would only except cash which is not unusual because I ve come to this location several times during the AM hours they will only except cash seems like all the time but after I FINALLY got my order this morning was pissed to find that my hash brown was hard as a rock WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN 
-1,This McDonald s is getting this rating not cause its McDonald s but because time after time it has been terribly poor service I have had one experience where a manager told me that I was wrong That clearly I ordered wrong All I asked for was a double quarter pounder with cheese meal They took down a quarter pounder with cheese meal because that s likely more common than what I ordered And instead of admitting they may have messed up she told me I was wrong and needed to just accept that I have been told that they only carry types of sauce for nuggets as well which I believe isnt true I believe they just didnt know the other ones and didnt want to find out I have also had large fries consistently only filled about s of the way Never once have I had a full large fries from there 
-1,Breafast burritos tortillas are always hard and eggs are dried out when I go late in the morning So I ask for extra cheese Cashier says they cannot do that because they are already made I tell her make me fresh ones She says she has to go see Comes back and says no I order something elsr and aak for fries It is only and we cant make fries until I can get hash browns at pm but cant get fries until after Makes no sense I ask for manager She says I am the manager Really Then why did you have to go ask about the cheese Do you always ASK your emoyees if tthey can put cheese on sonething So now she not only gives bad service but LIES to me about being manager I want call from OWNER
-1,Everytime I go here they seem to have an issue with charging for ranch Today a told them at the speaker box twice I wanted a total of ranch Which honestly I could use five or six When I got to the second window I only found one It was a manger serving me I explained to her that I asked for a total of ranches She hands me and proceeds to tell me I was not charged for it Annoyed I grab the change and explained to her I ask for extra everytime and it ends up like this At this point the manager quickly grabbed more and rushed me off I understand I was not charge I am willing to pay the extra dollar or for extra Please dont be rude to me cause I like enough sauce for my nuggets 
-1,The place sucked The manager forced us to used the self order kiosk which I hate using If I have to take my own order give me an employee discount Then a girl behind the counter told me their coffee machine was down then offered me a cup of regular coffee I m place of the McCafe I ordered for Then I ordered apple pies and found cherry pies in the apple pie box I was the told they only had apple pie left Instead of offering a refund I was asked if I wanted one I was given the incorrect amount back for my refund It was the worst Mcspirience I ever had 
-1,Was told to wait on the side of the building which is typical when long lines form in the drive thru These guys didn t have the courtesy to bring me my food I had to wait outside in the heat for minutes before I got fed up to go inside and have one of them say It s been ready Worst customer service I ve ever received at ANY McDonalds Way to be terrible 
-1,Bad customer service drive thru won t even listen to ya told them I had coupon on my phone said yes and then charged me full price Inside is ghetto not very good hiring staff obviously I was there when they had to call the police on one of the employees who was sitting there yelling slurs inside This place sucks overall crappy food anyways eat somewhere healthier and classier with better customer service I suggest a
-1,I guess my expectations should be low Inside smelled like T somehow Management and staff were having loud personal conversations that included cuss words Talking about how they were so ready to go home cant deal with this bs Among other things One manager was on her phone while tending to fries Cashier was soft spoken and rude or clueless Gnats flew around my food as I ate I was given my ice by the cashier from a bucket behind the register There were no ketchup or napkins out for self serve so when I asked for them they were thrown on my tray It is McDongles after all 
-1,Every time I go to this McDonald s my order is always missing something

-1,Can t believe this place is brand new and the parking lot is as horrible as it is This is the worst design I ve ever seen If there are people in the Drive Thru everyone in the parking lot is trapped in the parking lot no menus no front of store employees and when you do show at the counter it s like the employees are scared to leave the kitchen like they have high anxiety of actually facing someone or something You can stand there at the counter forever and no one will ever come
-1,After sitting in the drive thru for an hour spending almost asking for sauces and getting on the highway we discovered missing large fries and no sauces We returned and received cold fries with absolutely no salt on them Others were also complaining of incomplete orders as well 
-1,Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald s and only for two egg McMuffins Then the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches The staff definitely did not want to be there It is my closest McDonald s but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time Just avoid this spot no matter what 
-1,It took plus hours to get thru the drive thru The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out No one apologised for the abnormal wait time When I got my food the fries where cold and the taste old I usually to not complain about a restaurant but plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous Especially for a fast food establishment 
-1,This place has ZERO customer service From no one being at the front counter to long waits to get food to getting your order wrong then getting cold food when they remake your order This is one McDonald s you ll want to avoid going to 
-1,I ordered from McDonald s and I did not receive my Sausage Egg McMuffin The previous times that I have ordered from this location they have messed up my order 
-1,Rebuilt McDonald s on a lot that is way too small lane drive thru weaves through the small parking lot making it impossible to get out if you parked and ate inside 
-1,Literally the worst they literally never have working registers crazy wait times tonight they didn t have food They said they wouldn t have any food for another hr I work night shifts in the Area and they 
-1,Don t go There s another one up the street This is the worst McDonald s to ever exist It s actually not even a real McDonald s I think the franchise owner is doing their own thing here the food 
-1,Super Long line drive trough night time this place sucks what a mistake if you have minutes to spare this is your place
-1,The new location is attractive The staff member taking the orders was great but the person putting our order together gave us the wrong items We paid for an upsize and got a lesser priced size Mcdonald s french fries are outstanding the rest of what they offer is oftentimes questionable 
-1,Don t go Usually meals have been sitting around getting cold and stale before being served in drive through I even asked server to please get me fresh fries since mine were cold and her response was 
-1,Never again will I order from here times ordered mistakes were made Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order Waited minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled 
-1,We have given this newly remodeled McDonalds a few chances The only difference is they now can jam more cars in their drive thru They will still make you pull up and wait for your order and forget that you re waiting Same problem as before Having this happen multiple times seems ridiculous and we don t even frequent this place Location is convenient but not worth it 
-1,Worst place ever We had to ask to clean the table because it s was filthy Then they never served our order we waited for min and it results that my order was cancelled because breakfast time was over and no one i
-1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE I get it s only food but it s fast food We waited over thirty minutes for our food and should be called slow food We waited at the drive thru first and no one was taking orders then we went inside and had to order on the kiosk because they told us too Why h
-1,Unfortunately almost everyone that works at the Lankershim and Riverside location are so unprofessional 
-1,I had a miserable experience with this drive thru Waited mins to be told they don t have the McRib or ice cream available The wait times are ridiculously long Go anywhere else but this location 
-1,Since reopening this location suck big time Cannot get anything in time the manager here is very poorly performing no people to take orders clean up or just run this place like a restaurant 
-1,They need to change the time that they open because the door state s that they open at am but when ask employees what time they will be opening they stated that they don 
-1,Um so this is not a McDonald s 
-1,Claims to be hours but it s constantly closed I go for McFlurries so i 
-1,Avoid this drive thru youll be stuck for mins My last visits the wait times were off the charts I give up off to a different location 
-1,They get my order wrong every single time It s kind of amazing actually 
-1,They always seem to forget something in my delivery order napkins straws a whole order of fries Pay attention people Okay this time you forgot a whole hamburger I ordered a Big Mac it s on the delivery receipt but it s nowhere to be found Furthermore you sent a cookie that I didn t ask for in this order What s that a consolation prize for losing the Big Mac 
-1,Worst drive thru set up I ever experienced No way out unless you go into the drive thru line and wait 
-1,It amazing how many items you can get wrong in one order Fries were double salted yet undercooked Soda wasn t what I asked for Really just bad service from the drive thru on multiple occasions This location does not properly represent the McDonald s brand 
-1,I ve already written a review for this place and haven t been here in a bit but this is an update The girl taking payments in the first window with glasses dark hair was rude and the nuggets I had ordered weren t warm and taste as if they were sitting out for a while And to top it off they gave me an opened buffalo sauce I can 
-1,After waiting in drive through for minutes I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either and a filet of fish with no tarter sauce and of a peice of cheese I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders and when I showed them the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag I showed her the bag being empty and even made the comment Even no ketchup She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be to minutes since my lunch is only minutes I had no choice but to leave 
-1,Food was hard and cheese danishes were hard Workers forgot to give me water bottles They were just talking and seemed like they weren 
-1,Good fast service went in ange cl was awesome in da drive thru be back soon
-1,Just ordered two large drinks and two large fries Both drinks taste wonky as if the syrup in the machines are off And to top it all off they had me pull to the side to wait on TWO large fries Won t recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonald s food drinks Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks I d hate to see what else they d wreck 
-1,This location should have stayed closed Why do they have a re opening sign when they re only operating for drive thru What about the pedestrians The ones who can t drive At least I was able to walk in and order food before they remodeled I live less than a mile from here and I can t walk over and physically order food And why is there a parking lot if we can t walk in And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru You re better off going to the one on burbank Blvd Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn t expect problems This isn t it McDonald s minutes sitting in a drive thru 
-1,I had quite possibly my worst McDonald s experience ever here After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin the order taker said ok I ll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you Um Ok When I got the order it ONLY had egg I politely informed the person at the drive through window but they refused to correct the order saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I d have to get back in line and place a new order What the hell I won t be coming back here 
-1,The employees just kept screaming the n word I wasn t even trying to eat here I was just walking by A
-1,The worst place in the valley Nasty personal nigth time manager it s the more inefficient person to rule a place no brain incredible how this person work in a restaurant Never comes back 
-1,All I ordered was mcribs for drive thru They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait Ended up waiting minutes before I got my order They claimed the manager couldn t find me It is a very small parking lot The manager didn t try very hard I ended up calling them to remind them about my order They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy The only explanation I got was we re so sorry I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite Lost my appetite 
-1,Bad Service Bad Attitude Gave me the wrong drink and charge me for sandwiches when I ordered one I was in a hurry to the office around AM and I didn t have time to argue When I got to second window and I was handed the bag and the window shut by someone who looked like she d rather be anywhere but there Terrible service 
-1,This McDonald 
-1,Ordered pies through doordash The bags come sealed so I know it s not the drivers fault They only put in the bag so half the order was missing Called to see what s up Christian basically told me too bad nothing I can do 
-1,This McDonald s is garbage Dirty No soda Only take orders from of the lanes Nope 
-1,TERRIBLE Got our orders wrong and when I got home it was missing my entire meal NEVER WILL I EVER RETURN HERE Manager Rosalina or Rosaline is terrible as well she is clueless and she has no idea how to repay or provide refund for this mistake She called back saying she can t do anything I m too busy I can 
-1,This place has changed for the worse in the past few months Previously well staffed with courteous people Now they don t even look at you when you place your order Not even simple please and thank you I guess the cream of the crop left and moved up Now it s staffed by stoner high school dropouts They co
-1,I was there this morning at a m thinking about ordering breakfast and coffee The woman on the intercom wasn t really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong I ve never had an issue with this McDonald s but this was a first and disappointing
-1,This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me I waited for minutes in the car and he never brought it I decided to walk in the restaurant they had the bag just laying there Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me Bad service 
-1,My whole order was a lost the oatmeal was not closed correctly and so all the order got wet and the oatmeal did not cook right Then they didn t even supply me with spoons I asked for cream and sugar in my coffee and they gave it to me black and they got upset because asked them please add what I had asked for in my coffee I ordered two breakfast burritos and they were cold it s frustrating how bad some employees are trained they don t have any pride on what they do nor care about service they provide is just a shame 
-1,We ordered our food It was free egg mcmuffin day and before we even sat down they brought it to us clearly it was made before we ordered It was cold in the middle They proceeded to stare whisper and laugh at us I was uncomfortable eating the food afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing 
-1,Lazy people very rude when they fall behind which is alot they dont use the register and wont help with kiosk they need new staff
-1,It took several minutes for someone to take our order then our order took forever and was wrong My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch This facility is dirty packed both inside and in the drive thru and is obviously understaffed 
-1,They got my order wrong This happens often To make things worse they are very inefficient Ordered a small fries they served other people before I got mine Seriously fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers I used to worl at McDonalds years ago and know how it should be run Horrible Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese 
-1,The staff who took our order doesn t have customer service Very impatient In fairness he is so quick taking our order and he knows his menu Sad that frappe machine doesn t work No choice as thia is the only place that s open for breakfast here at universal 
-1,I ordered a Mcdouble which was on their outside drive thru menu When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble no bacon So all they did was note NO Bacon and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble When I got to the window I clarified again but was told they didn t have that in their system and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn t have what I ordered I told him to go out and check his menu because it was on there He told me he didn t need to that it was not on the menu He was very rude and dismissive I realize it is just a few cents difference but why should anyone pay for something they didn t order especially if what you ordered is on the menu I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally and rudely I don t recommend visiting this McDonalds luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect 
-1,Drive thru order was botched We paid for two milks and upon arriving home discovered that there were no milks and instead of the healthier grilled chicken that my wife ordered she was unable to eat the crispy chicken that we received due to dietary reasons what a waste Hopefully somebody got the milks we bought Avoid the drive thru at all costs This was not the first time and we should have stopped and checked the order Never again
-1,I just left there mins ago and my fries were horrible They weren t even fresh and definitely something I would NEVER give to a customer
-1,Had a terrible experience from start to finish An order taker in the drive thru even though there was not a back up he interrupted my ordering got it wrong i corrected him the cashier had it wrong i corrected him then they handed me the wrong order then the fish sandwich was burnt and tasted old and the chicken nuggets tasted like very bad chicken Worst McDonald s experience ever 
-1,I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times 
-1,The rudest and least compentent staff I ve ever found at a Mcdonald 
-1,Stopped here on the way to LA Every employee i talked to had TERRIBLE customer service Everyone there looks miserable I heard a man ask to enter the mens restroom to just wash his hands while they were cleaning the person cleaning refused and then he asked the lady at the register if he could ask the person cleaning to let him inside the restroom and she told him to go to the womens restroom with a huge attitude Really rude workers 
-1,Never a correct order last night they forgot to put patties on both kid s hamburger buns the kitchen timers are always beeping not very clean parking is limited Staff is friendly Kids like it so we ll continue to come here

-1,Food was slow to get and cold And if you don t ask no butter for your muffin and no ketchup Very sad who works there 
-1,How incompetent can you be when you have all this staff standing there and no one willing to help the customer why does a manager have to tell their employees to help a customer You see a customer you help them On top of that a lady that put her order in the kiosk after I had given mine was given her order first We literally ordered almost the same things and she was helped before 
-1,System is randomly down at at night and they can 
-1,The absolute worst McDonald s I ve ever dealt with The most incompetent management I ve ever experienced First out of my last breakfast orders were wrong But didn t realize until I got to work I cannot leave my job to go back Then today I got a steak egg and cheese bagel Which was right with the exception of long black hairs in it I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager The first manager only asked for a receipt She then left and got another manager She was a heavy set black woman She was the most ignorant vile person that I ve ever dealt with Not even an apology Her response was to bring it back hours later When I said that was ridiculous she closed the window and walked away I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up She is clearly incompetent and doesn t deserve her jib Funny thing is I didn t ask for anything free An I m sorry may have been enough But nothing even close I would never recommend this dump of a McDonald s nor the clearly racist manager I will stop at nothing now to make sure she can t treat anyone like this again
-1,Whatever you do do NOT go to this McDonald s location There s a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain why While the food there is good I simply cannot stare at these people the same way anymore A hour or two ago I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register I don t remember her name but I assume she was a manager or something She was in a blue shirt and glasses and that s all I can remember There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked key word here is politely them to investigate it and make it stop They didn t bother to check it which shows that they re neglectful of the resources around their workplace The reaction I got from this woman was disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call on me It s pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day Clearly I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage You know what they call people like her A bully I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment she needs to be put in her place because that s NOT how a manager should treat her customers I do not like being antagonized especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit Come to think about it I ve been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person Obviously I m heartbroken because now I don t have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift I m only relegated to the Chick Fil A a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did and their food is also good As a man diagnosed with autism I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs If you really need to go to a McDonald s steer clear of this location It s not worth your time and it s not worth your sanity Also their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didn t fix that either I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location 
-1,I got what I ordered wich was an ice coffe and one sausage burrito There was no line how ever the attendant was not attentive causing my Check out time to be close to ten minutes for a very simple order I have to change my rating to one star shortly after eating my burrito I got very sick to my stomach 
-1,Slowest McDonald s I ve ever been to and screwed up my entire order Also waited minutes and food was cold Will never go back Simple job yet these people are incapable 
-1,Being a pregnant female the experience I had with working there just recently was very terrible I was treated very poorly by my managers and coworkers I had only one break my entire shift which means I could only eat one time and my manager daisy made me take a break in the mornings which wasn t right to eat early and then go hungry till I got off Daisy was a very rude manager gave me a hard time on my rd day I told them this was my first time working there never don t a job like this as a manager she should ve been more patient and had some respect She even talked about me to her friends but would speak in her language so I wouldn t understand Karen was another manager that was never the was training me and was pretty rude as well Rachel was another I would like to sue for discrimination against my pregnancy and harsh treatment during my time working there I felt very uncomfortable The Hispanic females that work there are like the ones in charge they even take mini breaks but I only had one my whole shift pregnant female standing in one spot for the whole day the only person that was nice was Kimberly I will be sueing this company and I should press charges against nicki Nelson 
-1,Very cold hash brown Egg mcmuffin not so great either
-1,I ordered breakfast sandwiches and hash browns It was in the afternoon so I didn t mind pulling to the side to wait After minutes no one had come out yet I went inside and by the time I talked to the manager it had been minutes She told me it was my fault because I ordered breakfast at noon and was INCREDIBLY rude with an unbelievable attitude I told her I wanted my money back She ignored me Five minutes later I started asking every employee if I could have my money back The manager first ignored me and then started yelling I finally had to call my wife inside to deal with her because she was so unprofessional minutes had gone by at this point Worst run restaurant I ve ever been to 
-1,Ordered a burger at the drive through I was made to wait for minutes and when the food came I was given the wrong order I brought it inside to talk the employees so I could get the correct food I spoke with the manager and she was unbelievably rude Acted like it was my fault that my daughter was given the wrong burger I finally was given the right burger but I have no idea why the manager made it such an awful experience To top it off I walked into the bathroom There was someone sitting in the stall He flushed and walked out He was an employee and he didn t wash his hands Just walked out of the bathroom and when I came out he was making burgers Disgusting 
-1,This McDonalds on Blackwood Clementon Rd is very unprofessional and I won t be going back there The staff are clueless about their job and they are rude

-1,Just don t The manager on tonight was not helpful I waited forever to order at the drive up spot Than waited well over mins then to pay and there was only car besides me in line and they waited a while to pay as well Then to not get my order properly made and then was told my order was made correctly and that next time I would be charged extra for what they had to do which was to make my order right I asked for a macchiato Got a large cup of sugar and cream WITH A SQUIRT OF ESPRESSO I wanted macchiato not a cup of creamer and sugar I asked for more espresso to be added and got attitude about it and was told they would have to charge me more next time FOR THE ESPRESSO They clearly do not realize what an macchiato is It has espresso in it and not just a th of cup of espresso Manager was not helpful Said that s the way its made I said no its not I ve been to many other McDonald s and this isn t how they make it I also have had this at a lot of other coffee places and that what they gave me wasn t a macchiato He said I work at other McDonald s no its not So I told him which one I like to go to that makes it right So then he proceeds to say we ll that is how our machine makes it Didn t want to help Just argue and get rid of me I didn t appreciate being treated like I was and that I would be charged for wanting espresso in my drink that is supposed to have espresso Could tell they were not having a good night and dint seem to care to make things right and wanted to just get rid of me So I took my stuff and left 
-1,I was waiting at pm and the lady said wait to me and then after minutes she said I cant take your order I explained my self I said was waiting minutes for you and she said it doesnt matter me Very disrespectfull gi
-1,Tried to order something at the drive thru around pm and was given zero response during the minutes that I waited According to what it says online the place was suppose to be open til am and yet I couldn t get a order in around pm I sometimes wonder if the owner knows that they been closing up earlier than usual 
-1,this location regularly overcharges in a two week period members of this household were charged for large fries and for a filet o fish meal this is not the first time this location has done this but it will be the last time
-1,The order clerk and her Manager Nikki refused to give me a glass for water accusing that I might steal soda Should I stop giving McDonalds daily business and another for my team because of Nikkis horrible accusatory stance The main manager should be fired for not training customer unfriendly Nikki 
-1,I ordered Mcnuggets They were okay At least I thought But by the time I arrived home my stomach was bubbling Had to move like lightening to get to the bathroom Barely made it I will never order from or eat there again 
-1,Since the kiosk was introduced into the restaurants the staff does not even acknowledge your presence Plus they are over staffed There are so many servers bringing food to the tables that they bump into each other and customers constantly And the overcrowded staff in the back looks like pure chaos I went to the register to place my order cause I prefer to talk to a human being and the counter person told me to go use the kiosk I m busy There is no organization and order just chaos and confusion With all the extra staff and the introduction of the kiosks service is even slower than before and they still get it wrong 
-1,Absolutely horrible place They have people working the drive thru speaker who can barely speak English get the order wrong and are not polite When I have ordered here they mess up the order almost every time I wonder if there is a manager here because the employees seem more intent on fooling around and laughing than paying attention to their customers They need to get things straightened out and realize that if they don t provide better service they will go out of business I will not return to this one and go to the McDonald s on Route instead 
-1,Very loud The managers kids and grandkids were running around the place and causing a mess Very loud and took forever to get my food I did not like this place one bit Maybe if the kids weren t running around doing whatever they wanted itd be better I recommend going to a different McDonald s their are a few others near by 
-1,These are the slowest off task workers I ve ever seen I stop here multiple nights a week for coffee and a bite It s always can you please pull around IT S ONLY ME IN LINE For what A coffee and fries 
-1,This location is ok When I was there last week was told to go to first window to pay No one was there waited a few and no one came so I pulled up to the next window Payment was to be made at the first window Then they get my order wrong I was missing a drink and given an extra fri So I had one person with no drink and Fri s that no one wanted When I told the girl I was missing a drink she just stared at me like I was speaking another language I left unhappy Went back a few weeks ago my husband s burger was raw inside For convenience on my way home today ordered meals Asked the lady at the Drive Thru to double check She looked inside said yes it s all there Git home Missing a burger 
-1,There was hair in my food so i took it back and when i told the manager she said to me theres no possible way there could be hair in our food I laughed and said well i dont see a hairnet on your head and she started yelling and arguing with me about giving me my money back She finally gave it back after arguing the point with me while i had a whole line behind me Ignorant and you do not treat customers like that Period Why would i lie about hair being in my food anyway We were traveling i did not want to turn around Haha what a joke Thank god i never have to go there again I dont live anywhere near there 
-1,The McDonald s on Haddonfield Berlin Road in Voorhees is the worst place ever to get food I ve ordered from there and they charge my credit card almost and only gave me half my order and never gave me my receipt so I have no way to get the food or get the money back So I would advise people to take as much time as you need in the Drive Thru to make sure you have all your food that you actually ordered
-1,Be careful the cashier tried to charge extra and didn t fill in the full order Had missing things On top the cashier got upset for asking for missingthings The
-1,We waited for minutes in the drive thru to be told they didn 
-1,Seriously out times they tend to forget at least one thing I go there cause it s a driving convenience but honestly I d rather drive the extra minutes knowing that I wouldn t have to turn back once I get my order The kids that work there are nice the manager Jesus bit of an attitude 
-1,They messed up a simple order like a four piece Chicken Mcnugget and a beverage The young lady taking the order misunderstood me when I be asked for a Orange drink and charged for a Orange juice So when I went to the window I thought the order was confirmed and corrected and the price was lowered but to no avail when I received my beverage it was a Orange soda I wet around the drive through again spoke to the manager and she apologized Last visit to this McDonald s 
-1,This is the most unprofessional McDonalds I have EVER ordered from I ordered using uber eats and when my food arrived it was packaged with stickers stuck all around the bag where as I could barely open the bag There is a gaping hole in the bag and this is not even to mention the poor quality of the food Half of the food was cold my hashbrown was crushed and bent and my sandwich was poorly packaged No care went into the process of my order I do not recommend anyone to purchase anything as little as a water bottle from this establishment I am sick to my stomach at the fashion my food was given to me in NEVER AGAIN 
-1,Hi I have just purchased medium fries and large chocolate shake I did not feel hygiene because they are cleaning their kitchen and they are serving at the same time with the same unclean hands without washing and without having gloves Guys please maintain some hygiene levels while serving customers 
-1,Your company is advertising support for front line workers but your company is very disrespectful to people who are helping others I was rushing from one state to another state to help disable children stopped for breakfast at this location I was told to wait so the person in drive thru could take another person s order who came after me The person never came back on to help me even after me steady saying hello and waiting I was about to be late for work so I left and went to dunkin donuts You guys should NEVER advertise free meals for front line workers when its clearly a lie There is no support 
-1,Had the longest wait of my life for some cheap food Not only was the wait long for everyone but whoever was working that day gave zero Fs because they kept giving me the wrong order and just told me to move up and then proceed to hand me a bag that they already handed to someone else that I saw digging thru it Mind you fries are all over the place and I m happy to enjoy a meal that s been on someone else 
-1,Nasty foul odor of chinese food overtook the place upon entering and in entire lobby Employees must ve had massive chinese take out order leading to the offensive odor I lost my appetite and will avoid this location like corona virus 
-1,I went to the McD s on Rt at Roughly hrs to get a pounder meal with a milkshake During the ordering a woman loudly voiced acrossed the floor to the young lady assisting me that she is NOT to take ANY ice cream orders after The employee was as stunned as I and ask why and in an Arrogant voice She said its because we GOTZ gotz to clean the machine Well I felt this was rude and followed up with a question to this woman I asked what if I get here at and ask for a milkshake She again in an Arrogant voice responded with you aintz getting it aint z The rest of the staff laughed when she made this comment After all this and being made to wait minutes for my order I requested a refund and to speak to the manager I was told by this woman that no manager was available So I went back the next day to report this incident I ask the front customer representative to speak with a manager Oddly enough she directed my attention to the woman that I had this encounter with the night before So not only did I get HORRIBLE customer service in a language and tone that was less than professional I was lied to as the customer service rep AKA Manager Nicky was available the whole time If Nicky is the Manager and is leading that team it won t be long until that location starts losing customers as they just loss I would go elsewhere to eat 
-1,Ok here goes I stopped into the location on Rt in west Berlin NJ for lunch today The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side I ordered a number artisan chicken sandwich meal I paid waited like minutes they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag I got to work and found out I didn t get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac Which normally wouldn t be an issue but I hate big macs I ve gotten sick eating one before and ever since I can t even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach Needless to say I wasn t happy I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonald s The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to get keep in mind I didn t even touch a fry She was super rude to me and said she can t do anything because I didn t save my receipt I don t know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that it s my food they re handing out And I asked her what s the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry she said no I asked for a new meal after minutes of her spouting off why she couldn t make it right she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back make an artisan chicken sandwich so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier just the sandwich so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from hours ago She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her What a horrible experience It sucks when you get minutes for lunch and you re starving and wind up not being able to eat and it s someone else s fault You want someone to make it right Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right It just sucked I ll NEVER go back there just because of her And I hope no one else will either That s how pissed if this whole mess made me

-1,I went to McDonalds for lunch with my little kids and Laurie took my order One of the items I ordered was cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD She missed the request for NO MUSTARD but I noticed the omission when she handed me my receipt When I told her that I ordered my cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD her reply was No you didnt After that customer service blunder she agreed to tell the person preparing my cheeseburgers not to put mustard on them Once we got our food I had the unique experience of listening to her berate her cooking staff because they weren t going fast enough for the next minutes while me and my kids were trying to enjoy our meal I will find another McDonalds to go to next time 
-1,A group of friends of us total were kicked out shortly after eating due to the store manager s orders Their rule is kids in the restaurant at a time because of an incident that happend a week ago where kids made a mess and broke a salt shaker Two out of the group left and it was us sitting there having casual conversation in the side of the restaurant and a second lady came up to us and asked us to leave again because football kids are coming in and that there were too many kids at one time Keep in mind we were not disrespectful or disruptive McDonalds was just a place to eat not hang out or lounge in our free time Nearing adulthood I felt very offended and quite frankly disrespected by store management AND their employees Oh I also waited minutes for my piece nugget and medium fries 
-1,This was the worst experience has very young childish and incompetent people working here messed up our simple order times overcharged me given no refund but given attitudes galore why because mgr was busy dealing with another angry customer behind me said too busy to refund deal with me when asked due to that wth I m Calling corp for my refund Treated poorly barely apologized terrible cust serv and fries were cold burgers bland no condiments given either min drive thru ended up minute ordeal

-1,I ordered a artisan chicken sandwich no tomatoes on through the drive thru and when I went to get my food they told me to pull up and wait I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets The sandwich looks like it was thrown together way too much sauce It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce 
-1,I always order the same orders of the pc Nuggets For some odd reason it s more expensive at this location than all the other stores in the metroplex If you like to spend extra money for the same exact thing you can get from another location for cheaper than this is your spot For me it s not The manager g

-1,My hash brown had sooooo much grease that it soaked through the bag GROSS I ll never get food from this location again 
-1,Manager on duty was very rude My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely In today s world where there are so many options to eat you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN

-1,It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money Also the manager just looks at you and not take your order
-1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service Never in my years of walking this planet have I ever experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location Charging me almost for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt the cashier seemed new but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty 
-1,Incorrect order and couldn t mix Powerade and sprite for some reason 
-1,McDonald s in Roanoke has been a disappointment to me lately It seemed like a good idea to use them as a fast stop for breakfast on my way to work this past week Unfortunately I was let down by the service I received The first day I ordered In the drive through and the lady taking my order seemed like should could not understand me so when I got to the first window and paid I asked for a receipt the lady s response was We don t have receipts When I got to the second window and received my food it was comandwich than what I had ordered I decided to try them again one last time the third morning in a row and the service in the drive through was rather rude just like the first time and I received the wrong size coffee AGAIN When I asked the man about it his response was I don 
-1,They need to get more training First they tell me I only paid for the sandwiches not the meal Paid Two sandwiches doesn t add up to that Came back told the girl I m missing drink She told me to go back around and re order I go back in line and get my drinks I get home my whole order is wrong Just looking at through the food there were eggshels in the eggs Just terrible 
-1,I have been in line for minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald s Sylvia said I did I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it s a two lane and I said no ma am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it s only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were in line waiting You re going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don t get two lanes drawn up Number two Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same I m very disappointed how McDonald s has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the are trying to prevent an accident I thought the motto is safety first 
-1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement The manager screams at everyone who is a customer To me his young pond has no experience in customer service I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location this is very true I have gone through drive threw and walked in To see bad people working there just do not care I did send message to McDonald s Company hopefully someone will see what 
-1,The drive through service is horrible They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait I waited for over minutes for them The manager Maria Gutierrez might have her last name wrong FIRE HER After waiting for so long I had to drive through again only for her to lie and say she gave me my food Very rude individual Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food 
-1,Employees change but as of at pm they will put no meat on your burger and no salt on your fries and if you ask for any condiments they will ignore your request They seem like nice enough people but their service is terrible no refund or remake was requested Never ask for your food to be remade Don 
-1,The manager who attended this Roanoke store was very rude the ice coffee s had no caramel flavor the cookies 
-1,f I could give it I would Ordered on their own mobile app so it seems like they chose not to read deliver the order actually ordered I collected drove minutes towards home before the kid figured out that his order had every single add on we had requested not be added I called and zero apology was told to drive back to the drive thru and collect OH KAY Lovely customer service already I get there and the manager asks me to return the wrong order I handed it back untouched and he made huge scene of firing it in the trash emmmm your mistake No apology and ALL the attitude Never ever again Calling the franchise owner I would hate this guy to represent my business I felt so sorry for his team mates peers who were embarrassed by him 
-1,The person who takes your order always seems to be mad the cashier is never polite and orders are almost always wrong Good thing other better places to eat are around here 
-1,They canceled my online order even though I ordered it minutes before close and was just turning into their parking lot They still had minutes to be open I understand I m skimming time but that 
-1,Good quick service But the lady that works at night front counter is very rude It s a way to say something People are spending their money 
-1,Very unsatisfied My husband and i came to this McDonalds it was locked and we had to used the drive thru and they told us they were accepting cash only We ordered and they told us to pull around to the second window We weren t told our total We weren t given a receipt either and we were charged for some late night driving home snacks Coffe
-1,I went there today with no cars in front of me in the drivethru I ordered one large Sweet tea it took over minutes for them to get I should ve have just went and got a fountain drink from eleven This one is always slow 
-1,I went to McDonalds this morning for breakfast and got charged for an extra sandwich so I asked for a refund they refunded the cheaper sandwich which was not the wrong one and I pointed it out and they said I was wrong and they refunded the right one I was like okay whatever then they closed to door to fix my drink they apologize for my inconvenience smile and tell me to have a nice day handing over my drink I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway I was nothing but polite Petty does not look good on you McDonalds 
-1,Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are months old Not a good location for the lack of service and food 
-1,I went through the drive thru and ordered cheese burgers I waited in line for like minutes I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasn t ready It wasn t even busy so I didn t understand why it took so long to make cheeseburgers After waiting in my car for more minutes I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted minutes waiting for food As soon as I ask for a refund one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me I guess they forgot I was waiting on it I will never come back to this location 
-1,The Staff is very rude Me and My friend were gonna order sonething over the phone as we were waiting for someone to answer the phone Me and My friend were telling Jokes to each other My friend told me a joke and someone answered the phone we didn t anyone was on the line so he kept telling me The joke so about of No where THE MANAGER tells my friend Stop prank calling here or I m Gonna call the cops and send them to your house I have Your Number My friend tried to Tell the Manager that he didn t know someone was on the line but the Manager decides that he isn we calling this Place back unless the Manger apologizes for being rude 
-1,I usually defend fast food joints even McDonalds Not a very picky person However this visit to this location was very disappointing Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars The employees were emotionless and seemed to be rushing you through even though it still took a long time And then to top it off they got my order wrong 
-1,The Staff is very rude Me and My friend were gonna order sonething over the phone as we were waiting for someone to answer the phone Me and My friend were telling Jokes to each other I told my friend a joke as someone answered the phone we didn t hear anyone was on the line so I kept telling her the joke so out of no where THE MANAGER tells me Stop prank calling here or I m Gonna call your house and call the police I have Your Number I then hung up Of course we got mad so my friend called them and asked for the Manager He answered and She explained that he misunderstood us but instead of listening to her He tells her 
-1,Really frustrated with this location I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there I know exactly how much my order should be I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual McDoubles I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order Or so I thought Instead of paying I was charged for ONE Mcdouble It may not seem like much but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices I wonder how much I ve over paid at this location in the past What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order So in order to determine why I paid after tax for ONE Mcdouble I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers 
-1,If I could give them no stars I would they have been messing up my order for year s Remodel didn t help nothing still sucks I ve complained to a district manager don t help I ve had nice manager but she still got my order wrong I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point or there was a hidden camera Cuz they got my order wrong x s in s row this place is A JOKE 
-1,Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading Fries were soggy and unappealing Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food Stay clear of this place Staff definitely doesn t care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment 
-1,Honestly I hate to do this but the moment I walked in it smelled like a porta potty and I was like let me just order I ordered hot and spicy s NO LETTUCE a large drink and a large fry The Coke was ok the fries like always not full but fresh and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without I told the kid in the front this sandwich has lettuce one it which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said well it only says one sandwich no lettuce I mean come on guys The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him just fix the dang sand which Don t sit there and argue So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it At that point I asked for a refund little did they know I speak Spanish So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh so sorry I am an inconvenience to you but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn t have been an issue Jesus the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered He gets a star But my experience was just horrible 
-1,I come here every morning for breakfast on my way to work Ever since they got the Angry Bird eyebrows chick workin the drive through my order is always wrong Not a little wrong like very wrong Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam But she trys to give me a Frappuccino Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive thru window I even have talked to the shift manger and he laughed it off I cant wait for the new Mc Ds to open on and

-1,Very disappointed with this McDonald s I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about minutes so I said to myself maybe they re cooking a fresh chicken so I didn t mind the wait Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt 
-1,This is the worst McDonald s I ve ever been to I ve tried it several times mostly because it s on the way to my work but after today honestly I d rather skip breakfast all together I got a completely soggy hash brown soggy all the way around I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top so all I got was espresso when I first tried it To add insult to injury they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out it should have been in a medium cup I worked at a McDonald s for over years and this one does not follow procedures at all
-1,I used to go to this McDonald s every morning for breakfast The customer service has gone to hell and they haven t gotten my order correct in the drive thru for days in a row No one speaks English well enough to complain they just look at you and smile 
-1,This McDonald s screws up of the time Tonight was the last straw My husband ordered large fries PLAIN McChickens and large drinks The drinks were great the rest was not even what he ordered and OLD In the bag was a fillet o fish which to my surprise was the only fresh thing medium year old fries and year old cheeseburgers seriously the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting Where is the quality They don t care if people are upset and or get food poisoning Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving but he didn t think to not surprised I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries but an extra sandwich but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it Way to go McDonald s for providing POOR SERVICE yet again

-1,As a frequent customer of this McDonald s I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor As a franchise you shouldn t be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine
-1,Number of times we ve ordered from this McDonalds Number of times they ve gotten the order right It cannot be spelled out any clearer Quarter pounder Absolutely nothing on it No cheese Just the meat and the bun It is so simple Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous So I get home to see if i can salvage this order Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it The stale burned bun breaks picture I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there s another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well I give up FightFor indeed

-1,They need to hire real English speakers It took me minutes to explain my order Then my fries were so cold they must have prepared them last night I had to go back inside and wait another minutes to get them replaced Meanwhile my burgers were getting cold There were Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard I don t know if anyone else was English speakers or not but all I saw was Mexicans working at noon Photos included Management or owners need to periodically check to see if their restaurant is to standards 
-1,This is THE WORST MacDonald s I have ever visited First thing I noticed Four white customers standing in line and the black customers being served their meals The BLACK manager custom made their sweet teas reassured them that all you have to do is ask for me and I ll have your back They left more than happy Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist the manager just looked at him and turned around In response that white customer left very angry before ordering After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites another white couple simply walked out without ordering Finally I ordered my meal A Big Mac meal It took five minutes to expedite my meal The black manager yelled out my number dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left No thank you no reassurance that I was pleased nothing I then waited MINUTES for my large Coke The cashier who is responsible for making drinks didn t know how to get more ice or restock the large cups To top
-1,THE WORST MCDONALD S I HAVE EVER BEEN TO I went there to order breakfast sandwiches for my crew to show them some appreciation for there hard work I ordered breakfast sandwiches to get to job location and count only in the bags I had to waste my time and gas to go back and get the rest for my crew They should really double check there orders before handing them out Also they are rude and unprofessional You tell them the situation and they look at you like it s your fault and dont even apologize for any inconvenience they have caused you Someone from corporate really needs to go clean house at this location As I am writing this I can also see all the other bad reviews about this location That s gotta say a lot about the GM running this store and his employees 
-1,It s unfortunate that after today I ll be going to the McDonald s on Beach yrs here days a week I order a large mocha I ve seen the management change about people and I ve made some friends All those people are gone I made a direct complaint recently because I ve had enough you d think I d go to a different McDonald s with that many issues right Well I don t think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service but its not changing My complaint was handled fast and efficient I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird a couple of days ago I came back and was asked to park in for it to be re made I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasn t satisfied with the drink we both laughed and she said ok Yesterday I waited an hr because it was raining crazy for a doordash They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder Today I go and retrieve my mocha again and the manager ask me how many were promised to me I let her know the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it it s taste burnt The gm says I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha To me that is calling me a liar Especially when you repeat it after I tell you I didn t come yesterday I doordashed and yall messed that up I also have dash receipts to show She then says I didn t call you a liar but I know I gave you a free one She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering No Have you ever experienced that I m here daily When I told her her staff isn t at the window just as she wasn t when I pulled up today she said something was wrong with the speaker No accept some accountability The last manager told me she was Rosa and that s not the same lady I complained on Anywho I told her I m not the problem and I m not sure why this hasn t been fixed yet but today I ve decided to switch locations lol drive further for good customer service Rosa thank you for at least responding today LargeahotMocha
-1,This particular location is by far starting to be the worst in alliance Their fries are always cold they sweet tea is nasty and the burgers are warm last week was our last time going to this location We ve found a better one
-1,Management is rude went in to order some food young lady a register was taking my order when the manager comes over a tries to hand me a mask When informed that i have a condition the keeps me from wearing one she rudely informed me they would have to void my order and cant serve me So loving that i can t get food without a mask and i drive a truck 
-1,I just went here minutes ago it took very long i never got my receipt ordered chicken nuggets and didn t give me any sauces after specifying I wanted ranch buffalo and bbq when i asked her for sauce she handed me Not only that she didn t hand me my money right and made my dollar bill drop on the ground she was a young Lady with orangy yellow hair Each Night is the same This mcdonalds has horrible workers and horrible customer service 
-1,The lady who took my order was on her phone She missed my order Had to order again to the manager and he was speaking rude The lady who gave me the remaining order literally threw it onto the table rolled her eyes over Not a good experience 
-1,Poor service They were super busy and took the orders pretty fast but they didn t make my order I waited minutes for nuggets and a small fry After several other orders that were placed after me were served I asked about mine and the lady handing out orders just brushed me off I just asked for a refund instead which was a lot quicker Thanks for wasting my time Ronald wouldn t not be happy not happy at all 
-1,The manager himself throws fries inside the to go bag maybe in the container and the rest all loose in the bag Has a salty attitude and highly unqualified position Not a good front for this business Recommend new management do the manager a favor and get rid of him I can only imagine how the food is prepared PS The chicken nuggets taste like out dated breaded shrimp 
-1,I ordered a bacon smokehouse meal The lady asked chicken or patty No where on menu did it say chicken The only thing I received correct with my order was the drink I ordered beef and I received the chicken only I ordered the meal and didn t receive my fries Then the receipt said sandwich only with chicken Usually when you order its automatically a meal unless specified otherwise I ordered the meal she heard everything I said cause she repeated it back to me I will make my stops elsewhere 
-1,I am only giving star instead of because the OTHER staff were great I listened to the manager verbally abuse the staff customers The establishment was a disaster including a gentleman with no shoes picking at his toes in the back booth I feel sorry for anyone having to work under this manager Even when he managed the courtesy to pull a employee to the back to speak to them everyone was still able to hear the highly explosive conversation l do however commend the other staff for holding it together although i did see one staff member crying while taking orders after a conversation with said manager I pray UPPER MANAGEMENT reads this review and does something about this situation ASAP This is the worst review i have ever had to write and hope to never have to write such a review again 
-1,The self check out are down and apparently they dont serve lunch till on Saturday This whole experience even with the pilot that shares its location was bad I did call ahead but i got no answer from the pilot Their showers and laundry is down they re doin construction but the truck parking lot is kinda tight If a mom and poped open a truck stop around here id give them business Also this mcdomalds doesnt have indoor dine in due to covid If you want to be comfortable and sit in a restaurant and eat come to my home state of fl amd get real southern hospitality We dont live in fear in fl I didnt think texas had well i leave it at that They could at least clean the sitting area even though it has caution tape and looms like a crime scene A little broom and a mop would make a world of difference but the dust that has accumulated out yhere could give a person a cold Companies really need to start rethinking this covid kick With resent events people are going to become more conservative with their money Oils is about to go up and energy pretty muck controls the market Might be a good time for companies to become more hospitable
-1,Worse McDonald s ever Every morning I come up here for work thinking it will be a new experience but I 
-1,Sign inside says now hiring smiling faces That s good because none of staff was smiling at all My Egg McMuffin was burned around edges We got sweet tea instead of regular tea Didn t ask about sauce just put in hot sauce Would be nice to get a thank you too Definitely not a place I would recommend or stop at again 
-1,All Mondays were supposed to be free coffee for the month of December only for school employees I didn t know that school employees go to truck stops to get coffee I thought that were more of Star Bucks coffee drinkers Very disappointed in Mc Donald s again 
-1,This location NEVER gets the order out the window correctly I was shorted half of my order AGAIN DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE I m so sick of this a refund doesn t mitigate the issue TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE ORDER AND MAKE DARN SURE THAT THE FOOD IS ALL THERE Y all are providing a service we pay you to get it right Over and over I ve had to make the delivery person do YOUR job And guess what Something is ALWAYS MISSING usually an entire bag Tonight there are no fries NONE On a order Ridiculous If I could give y all no stars I would 
-1,It s a shame that I have to rate Mcdonalds a star but the service I received tonight was by far the worst I have experience and it needs to be addressed because now I will not be going back but the young lady that was working drive thru tonight her name is Elise was very rude and can not believe the way she talks to customers this is how exactly it went word for word and I work in customer service so I know how customers can be over the top when there complaining but word for word this is how it was I honked my horn as I was in drive thru after I received my food because I had asked for ranch sauce and was given buffalo keep in mind this is not a big deal for me and I will not be rude to the young lady over this but she took my honk as i did not have manners which is by far not my intentions I was simply trying to get her attention She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk And started going off on me about manners by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause I m black I was so beyond upset I have never been talk to this way from any restaurant and really do not know what this girls deal was and how did it lead to her assuming it was about her being black Will not be going back 
-1,I did an mobile online service and for the first and the drive thru person was so rude and didn t ask me for my order number but said my name I pulled up to the window and waited for my food and the drive thru person end up asking what my order was I am like are you serious and so I told him and was so mad cause I went to this location before and always had nice people but today and for now on I will not return to this location because ever again One bad experience makes you not want to come back Even the manager sounded rude too 
-1,I stop here often only because it is on my way to and from work but seriously this is by far consistently the worst McDonalds I have ever visited The milk shake machine is always broke down as was tne case today I ordered a big mack hold the catchup fries and a diet coke I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt yes I heard you Guess what not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke Well at least the fries were right I honestly believe the main problem is that the people taking orders at the drive thru speak poor English and obviously understand it equally as poorly toped off with very poor customer service skills They s eriously act like the customers are a bother 
-1,I dont eat breakfast without mac sauce they have given me mac sauce with my breakfast before but now they won t so no breakfast for me Lost a sale because their to lazy to open up some mac sauce just wows me 
-1,After waiting five minutes in a drive through line the vehicle at the ordering microphone had to jump the curb to exit the line because the drive through lane was blocked by another car at the pickup window When I pulled up to the order microphone I was greeted with pleas wait a second I replied i ve been reading the newspaper for the past five minutes and you are telling me to wait a second He said the computers were down and that they were accepting cash only If they had any integrity for customer service they would have come out and told us that five minutes ago I also had to jump the curb to leave the line When I did I was met with yelling from a person in the parking lot 
-1,They used to have average customer service and take forever in the drive thru Now the customer service is also bad The lady at the drive thru can not get my order right for the life of her and is just rude I mean it s convenient for me as it s on my way to work but if you can avoid it do yourself a favor 
-1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE This is the worst MacDonalds that I ever visited Worker with cold touxhing her nose several times and then handling food Bad customer service worker at cash register treating customer s with a reallt bad attitude Morning shift manager seems that she don t care about customer complaints Management and front staff need to be fired 
-1,Oh gross dont ever eat hear now they are all dope heads here took min to get my order that only consisted of small fries and cheese burgers
-1,The whole time the worker was taking my order I felt rushed she was rushing me when I got home and checked my bag two barbecue sauces showed up on the screen when I was ordering but when I got home I was disappointed to see no sauces were in the bag 
-1,They are a crappie place starting off with rude people especially the guy in the drive through I ordered a large orange juice with my breakfast meal then another meal with a large coffee the drinks were wrong then he says i have to charge you more for the upgrade so different transactions receipt then on the second receipt he didn t even want to give me
-1,It s fine that they re resetting their computers a bit later than they should but to have their crew members unable to price out and take an order is unacceptable Might as well close the store temporarily at that point 
-1,The cashier ignored me minutes and then finally whenever I asked if they were going to take my order she rolled her eyes and took my order and then I m not sure if they just forgot to make my order or accidentally handed it out the window but after about minutes I asked where my order was and none of the employees had any idea I had to repeat what I had ordered about three different times and then about ten minutes later I got my food I was on a lunch break at work a my entire brake was spent being ignored and waiting on food to be remade I will never visit this status men again 
-1,Came to this McD this morning No my usual spot Lol Asked for water no ice got ice water Side of gravy Gravy is spoiled Asked for splenda Got Did not get hot cakes and there was a busted syrup in the bag with the splenda and gravy on its side There was a manager at the window I always say please and thank you to everyone I know it is busy but it only takes a second to listen to someone you are serving Chick fil a is always busy but you don t get this stuff there 
-1,This restaurant really needs to get on board with keto or low carb burgers I asked for a quarter pounder with cheese and bacon wrapped in lettuce They first brought it out without lettuce then they took it back after I asked it to be wrapped in lettuce a nd time I just threw a piece of lettuce on the top with no condiments

-1,Stop here only if you re desperate We came by late and hardly anyone was in the restaurant yet they were still extremely slow We waited about minutes for orders You order on screens instead of with a person and the system still feels like it s in a beta mode On the bright side you can get booze next door while you wait 
-1,Placed a mobile order for pickup Waited minutes for a single burger that never got called All of that wouldn t be so bad but when I called for a refund I was lied to by the manager that they called my order which they did not I stood inside for minutes watching the counter to see if they had my order So they lied and kept my money 
-1,PLEASE CHECK YOUR TO GO ORDERS BEFORE YOU LEAVE I would give negative stars if I could I ordered a to go order but ended up staying to eat in the dining room I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there It literally had no top hamburger bun and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a quarter hamburger was When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didn t even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up no gloves and slap an undercooked bun on it and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about what s missing here It wasn t even busy in the drive thru or the dining room I can t pretend to know their job or lives but I hope they aren t this effed up to every PAYING customer I ended up asking for a refund and not taking the burger even this was an issue Please beware I only regret not getting their names to report them Again not trying to be a drama queen but I worked hard to afford this little splurge to get this slap in the face

-1,It was a ridicously long time to get my food There is ONLY people working here The person at the drive through window is having to go back and forth to take orders inside as well The self serve soda fountain machines are turned off so I have to wait until the drive through guy eventually makes his way to the inside counter to get a re fill I have never seen a fast food restaurant so under staffed 
-1,Went with wife and daughter Ordered McDonald s and a kids meal Took mins to get food Everyone was waiting that long and room wasn t even busy Workers were just standing around in back bullshytting Lady called out my number and was very rude as she just dropped bag on table will not be back if you hate your job QUIT 
-1,The drive through staff is very unprofessional they leave you sitting at the speaker box waiting to place an order they have a very rude attitude when taking your order and they act like it is an inconvenience for you to be there This is already a very overpriced McDonald s because of the strip location Find a better place to visit for something to eat it s not worth the hassle here

-1,Called to complain about the utter mess of an order I received Out of sandwiches they were all wrong Not edible to my family I am handicapped with the use of only one leg and this restaurant was the closest I was able to walk to During the phone call the manager wanted me to walk back to the restaurant to handle the situation I just asked for a refund and she said no cant do that walk back I would like my refund and she should be fired

-1,In the USA the bottom of fast food is just as low as here Or a little better there A Denny s or a Wendy s sells homemade burgers for this Kar that there is not a single fast food chain in Hungary 
-1,I understand this is a very busy location but each time we have bee there there were no pies and in a WEEK PERIOD NO ICE CREAM SHAKES ETC In my opinion this is unacceptable We ordered the limited time offer of McCrispy ranch sandwiches the chicken was over deep fried and almost un edible finally kiosks were out of order except one and only one cashier very disappointing love McDonnalds 
-1,dude we ordered first yet we had to wait minutes js to get our order people who ordered after us got theirs before us such a slow fast food restaurant work better 
-1,Awesome spot with a great view but the staff don t seem to care about allowing the trash cans to overflow or all the crazy homeless hanging out on the patio
-1,This is an ideal location across from Waikiki Beach the tourist destination however is infested with homeless protected by the local police Our drinks were stolen from our table as my children sat and waited for my wife and I to retrieve our order We called a manager to pull video surveillance which showed exactly which homeless person stole our drinks and called the police to file a theft report The local police were completely useless did not press any charges despite video footage sided with the homeless thief and said if they arrested him that a thousand more would do the same thing Really I received zero apologies or compensation from McDonald s the police I called or the thief in the photo In fact the police apologized to the homeless thief for bothering him prior to leaving The homeless thief remained in the restaurant We will never eat here again despite the fact that we 
-1,No Mocha Frapoes Boohoo Food here was dry flavorless no seasoning Homeless are camped right at entrance smells like urine trashy alcohol smell sorry but this ones a Yucky MickyD for sure 
-1,No bathroom what McDonald s has no bathrooms Clearly an anti homeless measure Instead of punishing the homeless maybe the city should search for a solution and all the wealthy businesses of the area should contribute instead of sucking the city dry 
-1,The day manager was aweful We were staying at the Alohilani Resort and decided we just want a simple lunch We ordered a Mc nugget meal fish sandwiches and two pies The pies were reason we went there I got back to the hotel realized they weren t there Went back she assured me she put pie in the bag I go back to the hotel find the reciept and my husband ordered two pies Instead of apologizing for error she said next time bring back the whole bag of food Obviously she knows nothing about the Aloha spirit which is prevalent all around the rest of the island 
-1,Worse location ever Waited min for our food they kept saying it s coming up next which was a lie I even ordered on the app
-1,I ordered a deluxe spicy chicken sandwich and not only did I get a regular chicken sandwich but it was also burnt I ordered large and medium french fries and I didn t receive any ketchup 
-1,Slowest most incompetent McDonald s on earth Don t waste your time here 
-1,Has a local menu Food is good but service is non existent here You have machines which i used to select my order however it takes forever to collect cash You are positioned in the busiest place in town and yet the line doesn t move I understand you have special needs working but that means their should be a nd person helping speed up the line up Went different days and whether it s late night or morning same situation Also You want to charge for tap water Never heard of a McD s charging for a cup of tap water before

-1,During our stay in Waikiki We always order for our boys happy meals With each purchase only ranch was placed in happy meal When we asked for the other happy meal we were told that is ranch per customer no matter how many happy meals you buy We went back and purchased the two happy meals separately to get ranch in each box 
-1,This isn t the typical cosy McDonald s When handing over the ice cream corn my wife did not catch well and dropped it on the counter Although the server gave us another one he didn t show the pleasure face but some madness in his face Definitely not the McDonald s I knew 
-1,Definitely seems par for the course in the new Hawaii Service was horrible Staff acts like you re asking them to pull their teeth out when you try to give an order Asked for sundaes got Asked for bbq sauce got Asked for a second d one and they acted as if they take it out of her check Seems the Aloha of Hawaii is melting away fast from their local businesses Fries taste like fish very disappointing
-1,Lost McDonald s in Honolulu if you can avoid going here I would The staff are rude and very cheap I ordered spicy chicken meals and our burgers weren t even in the bun everything was all over the place When I asked the girl there for more sauce since we had burgers and fries but she said they don t give it I went to the McDonald s mins aways yesterday and they gave me as many sauces as I needed without charge I would suggest walking the extra mins and going to the other McDonald s its worth it Avoid this staff rude and cheap 
-1,Everytime I visit Waikiki for a vacation this mc Donald s milkshake and ice cream machine never works This has been ongoing
-1,Kiosks all broken Long line One person working check out Slow and bad experience

-1,No restrooms there is no place to wash your hands 
-1,The manager Wesley shouldn t be leading a team the young guy obviously has lots to learn about customer service manners and common courtesy We walked up to the counter where he was standing Right when we were about to ask to order he simply walked away quickly without giving us any acknowledgement or finding someone else to help us in lieu

-1,Ordered some breakfast and three extra milks never received The three milks Let s be honest how hard is it to work at McDonald

-1,Slowest employees ever They are the most inefficient group of workers Feel bad cause they re older and look like they are kind of trying But everyone in line was frustrated af 
-1,The main reason for the star is the overnight lady that works the cash register is extremely rude has a terrible attitude I live close by and the time before i last i went she was very rude that time as well also that occasion my nuggets were cold so this time i asked for them to be made fresh upon asking i recieved a dirty look rolled eyes and a grunt the next time i go if shes rude again i will get her name and do another review
-1,Awful service We waited mins from ordering our food to actually getting it Staff were extremely unhelpful
-1,Went after midnight had a decent line Service was slow Server could barely speak English which made other customers irritated that I observed Fries were barely salted as I watched them take it out the fryer They also barely filled them up to it s full capacities I dumped my medium and my friends large and they were both small in size Chicken nuggets tasted like cardboard Mcchicken had too much mayo Sucks Mcdonalds 
-1,I went late at night at am and I guess their registers were being counted or something so they manually calculated everyone s order at the time All in all this one cashier is a complete idiot she gave me the wrong change even after I corrected her but she didn t care Had to speak to another employee and then the manager to get my correct change people with similar orders received their orders before I did and then again I had to bring it up for them to realize I ve been waiting Worst experience ever and never going to that cashier again 
-1,If you re planning on eating their allow enough time to stand in line I ve been there the last two days service is very slow The chicken McNuggets tasted like a fish sandwich And if you going to eat make sure you go to the bathroom because there are no bathrooms at this facility I think they should just shut it down
-1,All right orders been wrong three out of three times I m just going to go to the one on kuhio Update order was wrong a fourth time and it took them three tries to get me a taro pie
-1,Huffy puffy employees with an attitude that will NOT listen I specifically asked for seasoned fries three times while ordering and then asked if she would give me the packets now as they usually do and she said I d get them with my order I did not Had to wait for the woman to come over again with the next order to ask for seasoning and she walked away before I could specify the flavor ranch Handed me a random flavor cheesy and walked away again Had to wait for her to serve the next order to ask for ketchup Overall very unorganized and chaotic service A very loud crowded and dirty location with no bathrooms I understand the employees are busy and under a lot of stress but the management needs better crowd control and to hire more employees to handle the work load and provide better customer service 
-1,Wish i could give this place stars Computers go down everynight at the same time and slows service This has been happening for the last years The after hours employees are zombies Very slow and unaware of whats going on in the place Trash cans are left over flowing and customer service is Have a good talk with your night manager Remember McDonald s is a part of the service industry i love McDonald s but myself and my friends will never set foot into this one again

-1,I came to this mcdonalds to pick up an order for a customer as I deliver with Uber Eats and the manager refused to make the order because he said we are too busy and dont have the time to prepare such a big order plus these are lunch and dinner items we will be switching over to breakfast in minutes So my customer was cheated out of their order and I was screwed out of I reported the restaurant to Uber support as well as Mcdonalds corporate offices Avoid this mcdonalds if you can Terrible

-1,Companies need to understand it s not anymore The public is tired of your excuses Be aware this location starts breakfast at am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash and mobile orders are not accepted and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this Maybe it s legit seems shady though If anything it is poor management It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start and the mobile app should not be accepting orders

-1,Couldn t even order I was greeted at the drive thru with we re only taking one order at a time there are people in front of you I ll get to you when I can so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed After minutes at the speaker waiting I pulled off without ever being spoken to again to find at least or staff members kind of just hanging out inside surely not moving the drive thru line along

-1,Be Aware Always a problem in this branch Either order is wrong or missing key ingredients in burgers like ketchup for example or stale meat ingredients or the high prices or the minutes long lines etc What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald s manager I was told there s nothing they can do about it Very bad area to be in for sure Ghetto employees and ghetto customers Better to drive couple more miles either way on than to come here

-1,The food is no good for you since I have found out since the last time I reviewed this that there is pork in their hamburger I will not be going there anymore I should sue them as what I should do I haven t ate pork in years very disappointing and you would think a big establishment like this could get turkey bacon or turkey sausage

-1,Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and that s what we thought we got Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there She was slightly aggressive we left

-1,The people in this place could not get any more Dumber Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drive thru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time 
-1,They were very rude and food was cold They refuse to let us inside and made us wait mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE Next time I m in town I ll never go to this McDonald s They were slow rude and not friendly

-1,Very bad so gross didn t do clean up 
-1,Terrible customer service ordered from the kiosk was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me To make matters worse the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees While they stood and had conversation I waited min before I received a Did you order Not even the management acknowledged me can t expect good service if the management doesn t know how to give it 
-1,They never seems to get our order right Thank God we always check our food and for some reason I always have to go inside and they get in an attitude So we will not be returning nor recommending to any of our friends or family
-1,I had the worst experience at this location I went to the drive thru and only ordered hamburgers and a small fry I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order I let the associate know it wasn t correct He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food As I sat and waited time was just ticking by After minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food No one came back I knocked on the glass and no response As about the th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed I asked where my food was and he said he was making it I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of minutes after first paying I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time minutes later He said oh I m sorry they re new Terrible customer service and uncaring management 
-1,Service was trash took them minutes to take my order no exaggerations Seriously can t even salt fries for some reason and the employees weren t able to organize correctly For example at one point there were three employees gathered around to fill one order ONE ORDER Seriously I d recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here 
-1,Worst MCdonalds experience ever minutes and counting and no order Don t ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad
-1,Service was terrible wouldn t allowed to use the app couldn t redeem point wouldn t let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger
-1,I m sorry to give only one star But during our visit were in the children s area of tables or seats are not clean It was uncomfortable for me to sit there There were many spots to see unappetizing if the area for the guests looks like how is it in the kitchen I do not want to imagine it I will not go there a second time 
-1,I placed my order at pm tonight and got the order at about pm I had to call to make sure they received my order Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy not this place 
-1,This was the worst McDonald s I ve been in We ordered using the kiosk and they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food We waited minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband s drink He went to the counter to get it and they didn t believe him at first My coffee had the label on it for what I d ordered but it didn t have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and the coffee was tepid I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald s for a while The staff didn t seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald s website and we left 
-1,I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order The manager Judith stated that if I don t come before am them I d have to wait until the next day to receive my order Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine I understand that my items were not available after that time but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are too busy 
-1,I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald s to in the past This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly At that time it was worth it The menu was cheap or at least what you know to expect from a international chain and since it s a chain you know what the food is gong to be like So let s look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants You need to set yourself apart with your service This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant Sadly I don t think they care anymore The last time we went half of the kiosks weren t working One of the three that was didn t print receipts This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious Actually there was a lot that played into it Now if you ve gone to McDonald s at all recently you know you pick your food at the kiosk get a number that you take to your table pay at the kiosk sit down and wait for your food Typically all of that takes about five minutes Well this day and what I ve garnered from tourists and locals on many other days the team at work decided they weren t going to bring the food to the table That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn t happen After about minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together only a slight exaggeration we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren t calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters Ok So I go up to the counter and wait We get our food minutes later and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected No big deal we are used to this My in laws are visiting and at this point I m trying to figure why they haven t received their order It dawned on me that my father in law doesn t have a receipt remember the machine that wasn t printing receipts The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt not the tent number Apparently my in laws food was ready in a master of minutes amazing since that is all customized and placed in the abandoned order area If we hadn t said anything they would never have received their food The lady never once called a tent number We told another person of the lack of receipt problem That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt she asked us what the receipt number was We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine and she asked again for the receipt Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump I m not sure if they just didn t staff well on this shift but like I said I ve talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while 
-1,Hands down the worst McDonald s I ve ever experienced Rudest employees Lady in drive thru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help Other people ordered ate and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over minutes waiting for double cheeseburgers and a fry A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer Never got my money back a
-1,Really slow service took over minutes to receive the food after it had been delivered to another table When it did arrive the chicken and burger were cold Duly sent back to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick but no apology 
-1,Take the extra minutes to go to a different location My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke seconds after it was handed to me The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who should ve been in the kitche
-1,Ridiculous i am not one to ridicule this is pure ridiculousness I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can t even get a kids meal right you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples I received double fries no nuggets as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets I tried calling when I arrived back No one answered the phone Here is your negative review that could ve been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues
-1,Slowest McDonald s I have ever been to in my life Took an hour just to order in drive thru Then took another minutes just to get our food orders burgers apple pie and pc nugget so shouldn t have taken to long at all
-1,Busy under staffed slow service condiment stand a mess out of lids ketchup dispenser broken I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table Very very ill run and poorly managed location Just awful 
-1,Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind cars for minutes Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car Rude staff as well Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that s saying a lot because I don t think anyone willingly eats at checkers
-1,I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds how do you screw up a cheeseburger I asked for no ketchup no mustard no pickles no onion I got no condiments and NO MEAT I mean really learn to read and pay attention This is my rd time this has happened 
-1,Extremely rude and impatient I asked for water cups with my meal and I got a glare and only one cup Then my brother who ordered a piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn t include any that we asked for after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got of the he asked for He came back frustrated with only so I told him to go back for more He asked the manager times to her face very nicely for more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother Not impressed
-1,Double check your orders I got someone else order and when i took it back The employee placed it back to give it to someone else I told her I touched the burger to throw it away She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away Horrible attitude from the cashier Order was not completed 
-1,Long line at kisok which was only way to order due to lack of staff Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk Tea was weak had been sitting awhile Terrible experience
-1,Worst customer service ever I was invited to come in after having to wait over minutes on the drive thru Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family I explained I cannot come back next day but would come following Sunday she agreed and hung up On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order While on the service line she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line she asks me yelling what is your name I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE other customers included yells again she tells me you came in already I replied NO at this point I m embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down Twenty minutes later I finally get the order I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold The manager grunts and agrees to After my family were done with their meals we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done When we returned we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered Incredible Bottom line we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonald s came through we got yelled at by the manager embarrased long wait for food missing food items and pissy attitude by staff Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for Sorry that we don t have negative stars because this location would take them all 
-1,After waiting minutes for to go food which I get it s orlando there was so much butter slathered on our egg cheese and bacon bagels they went in the trash W

-1,Showed up minutes before the menu change and was told I couldn t order what I wanted off of the advertised menu When I question that to the employee they basically said they were too underpaid and lazy to make me chicken nuggets and all I could have was the two mcChicken sandwiches they had left Or nothing Great customer service NOT
-1,If it were possible to leave stars I would Absolutely zero customer service The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed neither of them spoke a word in person The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn t be bothered to tell us which of the pick up windows to stop at I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy but they weren t at all Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction 
-1,As usual the food prep people don t know how to read a order slip Big mac no sauce no cheese What did I get Big Mac cheese ONLY on it Ya ll did make it thru first grade so you could read simple letter words Right Just asking

-1,Just horrible service this is probably my first review ever and sucks it had to be a negative one if you don t like your job then it s best you quit without bringing down the company with you lady in the drive thru window at this hour was making fun of patrons trying to order and I happened to overhear Not something you want to hear when ordering to be honest

-1,Worst McDonalds I 
-1,This location has slow service and horrible customer service The computer order machine was not working instead of informing custmers they said nothing Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees For such a big business and being involved in so many charities you think they would emphasize excellent customer service McDonalds you are slipping 
-1,This McDonald s was the worst i haver ever been in ZERO STARS Floor in entrance was flooded Bathrooms disgusting Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice Garbage cans over flowing to people inside with one person working the register This after sitting in drive through fir to minutes without moving 
-1,What is the point in having employees in a store if they don t help you The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine The store was empty What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order They are getting paid to chit chat Bad customer service 
-1,Thought it would be a standard mcd s however after placing our order and putting the table number for the meal to be delivered to us it wasn t We went to counter to find part of the order sitting there then we were given the order with a lot of items missing 
-1,Got the order wrong Went back They told me to pull up nd window They forgot me Then got the order wrong again 
-1,If you like to sit in the pick up line for minutes and when you finally get your food it is not at all what you ordered then this is the place for you

-1,Food was decent until I found a tooth pick in my fries unfortunately there wasn t anything I can do or say since I was just passing through on vacation from Chicago
-1,Spent minutes in the drive thru most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food Didn t get a straw my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my son s happy meal had no toy All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn t get either one right even after a minute wait Completely unacceptable

-1,The staff here is not friendly at all Where I grew up you greet somebody or at least say something The drinks tasted horrible 
-1,Absolutely Terrible Food No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy The staff is polite but McDonald s You WILL continue to lose business People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients that s in the production of your food Even the yogurt has MORE SUGAR THAN A SUNDAY I wouldn t even recommend the fries Unless you want a Heart attack with a side of High blood pressure and Diabetes with a POSSIBLY of cancer then okay go for it 
-1,Absolutely the worst service They can t figure out the mobile app orders when asked how to fix issues with long wait times the ride staff just says what do you want me to do If you like people being rude to you and very slow service this is your place to not eat 
-1,Seems like the more one goes to this location the worse it gets toasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task it wouldn t be bad but lying about toasting it Shame on them apparently after a certain hour it is not a priority to make decent food for the public or decent fries not to mention a double cheeseburger simply gross Good grief this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops to keep going by cause Checkers is right down the road 
-1,I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald s for four days now Every morning we walk over to McDonald s to get bacon egg and cheese biscuits and hash browns EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we ve went over there we have gotten hard rubbery cold biscuits Their hash browns are hard as well and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with better biscuits However the replacement biscuits were undercooked They were very doughy I do not recommend this place to anyone The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food 
-1,Just went and got McChicken Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger The entire order was old French fries were saggy like and old lady titis The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down First is the shake machine and now the coke Come on man Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck
-1,I guess when you re in a tourist area you don t have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business Stale burger buns cold and burnt french fries Medium fries box was about full Drive thru employee didn t say two words to me beyond the price of my meal 
-1,I went through the drive thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I ve now been sitting here over minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald s to go to seeing as they don t seem to care about their customers
-1,The worst McDonald s I ve been to Went in around maybe at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel Went inside because the drive through line had at least cars no big deal I was ordering a carryout Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the piece chicken nugget meal I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then my boys love McDonald s she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day I asked her name but it couldn t really understand what she said because she was talking fast Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend she didn t know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn t remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it Manager didn t believe me I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal 
-1,Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating then he just threw it away hopefully he does not get sick Kids meal CB ordered with no onions not rang up that way was covered in onions Lessons here cook outs not being done to make sure on quality not serving raw product cashier needs a little more training because when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions a Large diet cook as the drink He did not put on there the no onions then asked me what did I want to drink 
-1,It s really ridiculous that I m coming every day for my breakfast at this branch and they don t care about customer satisfied every morning I ordered hot coffe and they gave me cold one Again and again it happened
-1,If I could give it NO STARS I would We waited MORE then mins inside for our breakfast Ok I can see if you are that busy need to make the food after minutes we got cold food the hashbrowns were so dripping in grease and cold disgusting

-1,An abysmal excuse of a restaraunt this location is a McDonalds only in name With a wait time of minutes at best for even the simplest order this location completely and utterly fails in its purpose as a fast food location I strongly recommend any reader to take their time and money to ANY other location 
-1,I m assuming this is the McDonald s on celebrations so that I write this review under the correct McDonald s on Celebrations Manager name with a J I think it s Jasmine or Judy I think it s Judy but young lady was not professional she is blonde and worked around pm I ordered my food in drive through when I got it the food was not good the meat was burnt the bun was hard the sandwich basically looked really old I came in told her the situation not once did she apologize for the horrible sandwich I had to ask for a new sandwich to be made instead of her even suggesting it she took the sandwich food preparation horrible food poor management needs to do better Took my money and went else where this McDonald s will no longer be geting my service

-1,Not only was the speed of service poor I waited in line for just under mins to receive my food thrown inside of a bag I did not eat either the pounder or the nuggets They really need to shut this restaurant down because for the love of god they don t hire decent staff this has been going on for years I m not eating food with strands of hair or food that s hanging out of a bag such ill preparation

-1,Can t change mobile order once placed I wanted light chocolate in my coffee instead of obese size pumps that drowns the actual taste of coffee and makes it taste extremely sweet Asked at speaker window window and the person that made it Can t do it And they forgot the hot sauce to my burrito But this is McDonald s standard 
-1,constantly miss items it baffles me I work fast food items pop up on a screen you put them in the bag its very simple half the time they put ice in the drink when I ask for no ice which again a drink pops up on a screen and underneath it will say no ice I m not really sure if yall just don t care or if this is really that hard 
-1,This is the second time I ve came to this McDonald s and they are closed How you hours but closed They very rude Last time they told me they open at am in the drive thru then this morning I was told am I come to this one because it s so close to my house But it seems I m going have to find another one This McDonald s need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant When I come to this McDonald s I always spend or better Get y all stuff together

-1,The amount of times I come to this location and the system is down is embarrassing I work in food I know when people don 
-1,I hate this McDonald s in the morning The drive through workers are undertrained and snappy there is a difference between a sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin I was overcharged the manager Tim had me pull up for whatever reason I assumed for my overcharge and never came out the door I go in after minutes and he acts unresponsive to the guy calling his name that s how I know what it is very unprofessional and I will be reaching out to their corporate headquarters about this matter
-1,This isn t the first time it happens but it s definitely the one that bothered me the most Went for lunch did a mobile order to make it quick and spent minutes of my minute lunch waiting for my food Had to walk in and ask for it No napkins or st

-1,Horribly slow each of the last times I ve gone here Attempting to grab something quick for my kids or wife and just no such thing as fast food any longer 
-1,This location has gone to hell in a hand basket Since they changed ownership it seems like management doesn t care anymore They re ALWAYS out of something Orange juice in the morning frappe mix ice cream machine is ALWAYS broken the self serve kiosks are always off line the tables are dirty and don t get me started on the bathroom 
-1,Maitland avenue bad customer service to the drive thru Stead of listening to the customer they just want to overshadow and run their mouth and tell the customer what should be on there when the customers telling them no

-1,I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life 
-1,Very slow customer service nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice Not up to standards
-1,Seriously this place is gone to the dogs Imagine sitting in line at a fast food restaurant for over minutes to get a burger and fries Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container I m so sick of these restaurants Fast food is no longer fast food the service is subpar and the food is not even as advertised I m literally getting jipped on my food while also waiting for almost minutes to get it 
-1,I m not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can t find anything positive This branch is the slowest I have ever been to It never gets my order right no matter how simple I made it The burger s condiments were all wrong The fry s were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate 
-1,There has never been a single time where I go here at night and it s open Not once Says it 
-1,I never ever go here because it s the most incompetent McDonald s I ve ever seen operate I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was so I know a thing or two about the process and how it s really not rocket science but somehow they can t ever get it right Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn t specify which one to go to although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know Tonight it was missing fries we ordered a total of whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while stone cold fries I wouldn t put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I m sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it I would be embarrassed to own this place Don t go here I know it s fast food and we shouldn t expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints Trust me it s worth the drive 
-1,Very unsatisfied order was wrong Management correct my order Just gave me an extra fry and dismissed me Will not be returning My money is just as good at burger King I understand that you are short handed but that should never compromise customer service 
-1,When I approached the window the gentleman cashier just looked at me I said Hello and he did not speak I handed him my card and he took it as if he were frustrated When he handed the card back to me I said Thank you and he said nothing back I m not one to usually make a big deal about things I try not to be that person however the way he acted was so unnecessary Maybe I reminded him of someone I do not know and never will know I just refuse to go to this location again 
-1,Went there tonight around and the drive thru worker didn t have his headphone mic off and just kept cursing saying this is bull and kept on I go to order my food and he tells me the milkshake machine is down No problem but when I politely ask if there s a certain time it 
-1,yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back I m happy I don t work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong and you pay for not what you get its sad we can t afford to pay for sonthing we want and get ripped off let s do better guys if you don t like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job 
-1,Today visit was the worse Other stops they forgot things or wrong in my orders forgetting hashbrowns wrong items drinks made wrong But today it took the cake The work took a couple of minutes to take are order Then when we got are order my wife check it all the items where there But only ideam that where right was the hash browns and a sweet tea Order a Bacon egg and cheese biscuit or hash Browns and sweet tea nd order was a sausage egg mcmuffin with a hot chocolate We got a sausage muffin with cheese and a sausage muffin with a hot chocolate that my wife said it was not drinkable If you ask why didnt we take it back We dont have time drop the wife off at work then i get on the road to go to work Dont think we be going back to this McDonald s its becoming more of a disappointment then a enjoyment

-1,Worst McDonald s in the area After waiting in line over minutes I finally get to the window for them to inform me that they were closed Mind you this was at am Saturday morning The store hours for this location reads closes at a m not a m Clearly management didn t want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing Will never go back to this location 
-1,I live close so I frequent this location They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can t even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer They just take the card hand it back most of the times without the receipt and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word Head a few miles down A A and get much better service with a friendlier staff

-1,This has been one of the worst McDonald s I have been too Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough The food now left a lot to be desired French fries were not fresh They had zero salt We ordered a piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces Then on top of that they re old and stale and cold Needless to say we will never be going there again 
-1,Miyra is extremely rude and slow Acts like she hates her job Took minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown
-1,Horrible McDonald s I had visited this McDonald s in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign or just tell me politely to watch my step I would ve kept coming to this McDonald s but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired 
-1,Today at approximately I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me give it to me now in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries now if you could give me a feedback because it really is not the way to serve the customer
-1,i m honestly only leaving one star because i have to staff was rude as can be i went through the drive thru and ordered a the cheeseburger meal and an extra cheeseburger with a small fry and at the window checked the food and the employee was rude asked if we got a problem and rolled her eyes well the order was wrong so good thing i checked went inside the store and finally got my cheeseburgers after standing there for minutes and complained to the manager and she walked away with no response Finally got my food and opened it up and there was A HAIR IN MY FOOD the entire order was wrong the first time around Never will i ever go back to this restaurant again terrible service i just ended up going bac

-1,Two employees preparing the food simply didn t wear a mask I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask Why during this pandemic which has not settled in the least have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers It s unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out With a mask on To save lives Consider this message before you enter this McDonald s Or any restaurant really because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time And the fries were luke warm

-1,No cashiers order takers you must use their self service kiosk which they have several of You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table however this wasn t the case for us The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby We were seated less than feet away from her and in her line of sight We raised our hand and said that s us She saw us but made no attempt to deliver the food I don t mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table but I m feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full service McDonald s charges Several people in store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold old or not made correctly This included us at in the afternoon the nuggets were cold chewy and seemed old I would think this wouldn t be the case given p m is during the lunch rush Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready Double cheeseburger was made correctly no mustard or pickles but bun was not warm dry and cheese was cold not melted managers were in the kitchen button up shirts with ties along with employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle paced leisurely stroll walk I worked at McDonald s and Burger King as a teenager and was always told If you got time to lean you ve got time to clean and that was during slow dead times not lunch rush I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be minutes for fresh ones was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one 
-1,horrific service this is NOT the world s largest McDonald s as people are reviewing on here this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC ordering at the drive thru took almost minutes this did not include waiting for the food the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him did not correctly take our order would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time i have never in my life been to a McDonald s with worse service avoid at all costs

-1,Arrived at the McDonald s at PM and the posted hours said the location was open until AM An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn t let us in until we mobile ordered although another employee seemed confused by this Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed again even though the hours stated that the location would be open until AM Additionally while this happened there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating and there were empty tables 
-1,Hours are inaccurate they close the dining room before not midnight as is posted on their doors The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee which makes it taste like burnt tea gross

-1,Went to this location around am and placed an order through the app Waited in the drive thru for minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open hours a day signs on their windows Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonald s 
-1,No chocolate shakes available This location should have good stocks of everything

-1,To hell with this McDonald s They closed their lobby 
-1,Worst McDonalds ever No personal service or friendly service Stay away and have a good day somewhere else

-1,This review is about the staff at this location I visited this McDonalds around pm to pick it up my food My wife did another mobile order and I just arrived and tried to explain to the manager I think she was I have another order that was not on the screen She was rude and answer one order at the time of course the first order arrived and I was still standing waiting for the other one more than min Another friendly Girl Danisha I thinks was her name tried to help me out and the manager stopped her and sent to carry other stuff in the back She was in charge for drive thru and one Spanish customer was making an order Danisha asked her to help and she said I can t I was shocked about this
-1,Food is terrible but the workers are very polite 
-1,Hawaiian Court location Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the Fast Food label From order to recieving the food it took mins and even then the order came out wrong There was one manager one fry cook and one burger cook trying to complete a dinner time rush yet there were cleaning staff going round cleaning table every mins or so This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time because this really was a poor attempt at fast food 
-1,Brittany The Manager was completely rude and wanted to call the cops just because I ordered a cup of coffee and their whole system was down 
-1,RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump We ordered doubles chicken large fries and large drinks Everything every thing tasted hard like cardboard The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones Both the chicken and doubles had no no no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke both were large size which they did not get right the first time Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor The food was over dry and tasteless The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday s old food if not last weeks old junk It s almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did 
-1,Horrible Service Lazy Workers Took Forever to make my order ans there liars
-1,Terrible service Cashier had a bad attitude and was very disrespectful Refused to give her name Found out it is Brittany Female manager seemed clueless amd not helpful whatsoever After over an hour from the time we entered the drive thru til we got our food it was still made wrong We ve submitted the issue to corporate requesting contact No response Obviously they do not care about their customers 
-1,Terrible customer service the lady at the drive thru was handing me someone else order after me telling her my order is an online order she then got mad and left the window then the second young lady told me to go to the third window without telling me that they just received my order and is in the process of making it I called the store and the manager was nasty after I was just telling him that Communication would have been nice and yelling at me telling me I don t need to tell him that and I asked for corporate number and the lady said they don t have it and I asked for her name and she walked away quickly from me rude everyone here is rude and disrespectful and no communication with there customers I would recommend going to a different location that s mo
-1,I don t understand why all the time that I come to eat in here is always a problem All the employees doing nothing the restaurante is always slow at night its empty and they take ho
-1,Only giving one star because zero stars isn t an option Wanted to pay cash at register and was told to use kiosk Kiosk never gave an option for cash pay Employees wandering the store on their phones and ignoring customers When asked for napkins an employee went thru two other employees instead of just handing customer napkins No organization at all and rude as can be Gave me diet soda when I asked for regular they rolled their eyes I understand it s busy but this place could be handled better Go anywhere but here 
-1,Twice they ve forgotten loads of my order on uber eats No refunds Nothing Absolutely a joke
-1,When you go on slow Thursday night order yourself a nice Double Quater pounder with cheese to go after a long days work Only to see you get a single quater pounder No cheese and i guess they decided to throw in some lettuce on there No sauce like pickles Too tired to go get a refund c
-1,Although conveniently located to several hotels the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located Even when we were at the window it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together Once back the hotel we discovered that one of our orders was wrong They placed bacon on one of the fish sandwiches 
-1,My friends and family were denied service at this location because we prefer to place our order with a human rather than a kiosk st by an employee then by the manager VERY RUDE am 
-1, McDonald s corporate you need to investigate this location immediately The customer service is highly lacking and I m positive the management of that location is damaging your brand Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited Zero response We spoke multiple times No reaponse No one greeted us No one asked us to wait Nothing Radio silence Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder Needless to say we drove away without making an order It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald s 
-1,We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the kiosks are open We wait in line for min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine but now I never plan to visit again 
-1,Waited in drive thru for mins finally got up to order nothing We kept asking if anyone is there Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system could be another mins at least We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building Truly horrible service 
-1,Terrible I never write reviews but couldn t complete my day consciously without expressing my frustration It s one thing to be busy and dealing with the public I know it s challenging To be rude for absolutely no reason when simply asking a question such as 
-1,I ordered breakfast at January order order We could have ate breakfast at the resort we are staying at but my family elected for McDonald s instead Not only did I have to wait an extended period three to five minutes at the order board but we had a large order When I got up to window number one the girl working the window was rude did not want to allow me to review my large order with her spoke extremely fast and unprofessional then rushed me to the next window without even paying Once I drove to the next window I was handed my food still hadn t paid tried reviewing the order again and the woman didn t listen or pay me any attention I sat patiently and she rushed back to the window to collect payment AFTER everything was given to me Our re under cooked mushy but the rest of or breakfast was good I would relay to your staff that the overall experience drives a customer back not just the food Wendy s filled the remainder of our order efficie
-1,We walked over from the hotel that was in the same lot The door sign said the dining room was open to am We got in the dinning room at about when other costumers who were already inside walked out We were asked to leave as the dining room was 
-1,It s not actually a hour store They re open but if you go at night around a m and a m it s going to be closed I think they switch for a dinner to breakfast but it s unfair for people who work third shift like myself I can almost never get McDonald s It s funny cuz they also barricade all the doors and drive throughs 
-1,Stop to get b fast they must have been in a rush cause when I went to eat my sandwich the sandwich looked like it was dropped several times

-1,rude customers half the kiosk malfunction and staff is not trained to help if it malfunctions Managers are so busy solving issues with equipment they cant manage the staff High turnover homeless people camping out inside Overall way to crowded and overpriced travel the extra mile and go to the next McDonald 
-1,With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast If you don t get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry hard biscuit I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone There goes almost ten bucks 
-1,Zero starts All tables were unattended They were all dirty Food took a while Manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food I stood for a few minutes ready to place my order I was the next client No one I mean Not a soul greeted me acknowledge my presence or anything Not even an exchange of words when I got my food which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me Not a you re welcome when I said thanks Nothing I would not come here again 
-1,Absolutely horrible place After waiting minutes we had to ask how much longer The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me The manager finally came and couldn t even find my order The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando 
-1,Dinning room was closed at PM Hours on the door say AM to AM There were many employees inside but they only served drive thru and refused to open dinning room 
-1,What an awful place Unless I am desperate I will never return here 
-1,I placed an order through the improved kiosk system and over minutes later had to inquire about it Turns out the order had been completed but staff were busy with other dutys so it just sat there So much for customer service However the shift leader did apologize Honestly I d rather have hot food And once in my vehicle I discovered the order was not even correct Failure level complete My first time in a McDonald s in almost years Now I remember why Given the choice I have no need to return to McDonald s ever 
-1,Well i have never ever been eye rolled on a drive through before but i guess there s always a first time for everything we order shakes the lady gave us spoons and we asked for straws she got offended by this and eye rolled us Training Training Training please to these people on dealing with customers 
-1,Worst service ever waited at the counter mins manager said be would be right there currently still waiting while review like dam can I get my Mcflurry Manager seen in photo 
-1,All our burgers were not cooked 
-1, mins on a Thursday night Nothing makes sense anymore with everything being terrible and no sense of urgency in any aspect of this place Fire the whole crew from the manager on down and start over 
-1,I really don t want to be that guy and I typically do not leave bad reviews But this experience this morning was absolutely HORRIBLE I waited min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to cook Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine My issue came with the TWO managers that were taking care of the guests Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it These managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn t work weekends Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness 
-1,worst service i 
-1,Massively understaffed min wait for food Also got the order wrong Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire inflation is rampant and end times are near Also every fat miserable Disney going family you d never want to run into frequents this place Avoid at all costs

-1,They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times It is not busy I just left and went to get food from someone else Why is that the only way to order I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers 
-1,Extremely unreliable Not enough staff to run the store Sometimes no drive thru sometimes OBLY drive thru This is stupid considering there s more people
-1,For me to give them a start is too much I went several time there and the foot is awful the chicken nugget the cold and old and I asked the lady the next time I went around if she can please make sure that the nuggets are fresh She reply fresh you want them fresh And I replied please Do I pay at the window pick up my order the one I drove away I grabbed one of the nuggets and that look and feel like they were sitting since the next day I have to throw my food away never again 
-1,Ordered using their self serve machines Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine Waited minutes No food Politely asked the manager behind the counter and they had missed our order and thought it had been prepared No apology just a rude manager telling us to sit down and it will be be brought to us
-1,Easily the worst fast food experience My girlfriend and I were feeling sick from needing to eat something and stopped here Location is hr but the doors were locked to stop ppl coming in A customer let us in and we were greeted to customers demanding refunds ridiculous wait times and them being out of many items Staff is very rude and condescending and the place is very poorly managed 
-1,Dirty store waited minutes for our food and never received it We left I would like my back No origination worst McDonald s I ve ever been to 
-1,Do not eat here save yourself time and money I ordered here times in a month and every time it was wrong you would think I would learn I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain Thinking the less work the better Nope some how plain means ketchup only Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD s number to complain I am local so I have choices to eat at other places You know what Wendy s is sounding a lot better these days It s not even a short staff problem its a I don t care problem I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others losing my order each trip wont hurt then in the short term But over a long time it will and will make sure I let others know to for go McD and go somewhere else STAY AWAY

-1,I came in at the drive through line was so long and I saw families eating food inside I decided to go in as it said the lobby hours are until I knocked on every door wondering if anyone was going to open up the door but no The worker shook her head at me sternly and wouldn t even give me the explanation as to why she wouldn t open the door Mind you I also was in my military uniform and she went out of her way to disrespect me all she would have had 
-1,Total dump Long unreasonable waits The dining room was filthy Missing sauce for nuggets No lids for the cups No napkins It s like dining in the third world 
-1,I can t even give them a star We had to order times after sitting in line for over mins they still got it wrong Their team needs training severely We ended up working with the manager and he did give us the food free spouse and teenage found it inedible 
-1,This place is awful The lines are looooong inside or drive through being waiting for minutes for happy meals I think is one of the slowest in the state Needs lots of work hopefully management gets involved and fix the deficiencies

-1,If I could give stars I would We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated we are short staffed and really busy we can t take any more orders for minutes and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders thats understandable but telling people you re not taking orders for the next minutes I mean come on I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business Seems like a poor business practice to me This happened on at by the way

-1,This place is terrible They have no inside seating which I guess happens But the manager on duty this morning when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear shameful we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order Wish I knew both names so that I call them out both good for the young lady and BAD for the manager lady on duty 
-1,Incredibly slow service sat in the drive thru for at least minutes without the line moving When I finally got my food the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all on top of that I wasn t asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces the sandwich didn t have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it just oddly dry pickles and a soggy bun I had to park and go inside to get condiments As has become almost expected with the McDonald s experience the soda tasted like sanitizer Never again at this location I only stop at McDonald s if I am blindingly hungry on the verge of passing out and still my past experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting Update Got food poisoning and this is the last thing I ate

-1,Literally the worst McDonald s I ve ever been to
-1,We waited for minutes in the drive through The line moved at the beginning but then stopped completely near the order box Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldn t escape We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait It was very frustrating The order we received was correct but we didn t get any apology or explanation We ll Mark this location on the map and never go here again

-1,I waited minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly If your reading this just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself

-1,Sometimes high tech doesn t mean faster Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive thru Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food They had just mopped with customers inside so that was a safety hazard Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor 
-1,Service at this place is a joke Sat in the drive threw for minutes waiting of my food The tea is bad percent of the time I believe this falls directly on management As there are always new employees there Most times having poor attitudes Also I have never once been suggested a pie I don t even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer And probably be un edible I only stop in there maybe once a month when I m in a bind 
-1,I ll start with the positive The food I received was the correct order and it was hot The bad What was supposed to be a minute trip ended up being almost because they were severely understaffed and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone Maybe they re better during the day but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you re looking to get in and out 
-1,Open hours but not before am 
-1,Terrible service waited forever for our food Won t be back 
-1,OMG The WORST McDonald s I have EVER been in Orders were on the board and they were just standing around like the had nothing to do Drive thru was closed so everyone had to come inside to place their order This was my first and last time I will NEVER eat at this location No sense of urgency from the manager on duty as well 
-1,McDonald 
-1,Waited almost minutes to get my food while people with bigger orders that came after me got their food When asked what was taking so long they said they are working on the order then followed by asking me what my order was After wards had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave The worst experience ever 
-1,Visited times over a week during a conference This place is a shambles The self ordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic Twice out of those times it s taken more than minutes to get a simple order and it s not even been busy The staff especially the manager Martha is aggressive and disengaged Overall a truly terrible fast food location 
-1,I don t expect star service when I visit a McDonald s but I also don t want an employee full of attitude handling
-1,Prices are way too high got pulled forward only to wait an extra minutes Still no food Went inside to ask for a refund Food still wasn t ready Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said oh our bun toaster is broken Didn t say that at the window This is an I DRIVE location Absolutely ridiculous Stay away What a waste 
-1,Took over a hour for my order and they need a PC system to let people know their orders are ready THEY NEED MORE HELP
-1,Just had the worst experience at this location Sidel who apparently is one of the managers and is Hispanic like me was extremely rude when we ordered our food through the drive thru She even was making faces at us 
-1,One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to There is no welcomes or thank you Service treats you like you are a problem for them ie the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off the customer said what about my drink The server rolled her eyes walked away brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away No I am sorry no have a nice day For me it took over minutes to just get a milkshake Never Again for me 
-1,Worst customer service Don t even bother to go We waited min for someone to take our order thru the drive tru Horrible and then the l
-1,To whom it may concern Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles I can tell by the damage to the curb that I m not the first to experience this and damaged was caused As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers The right think to do would be to correct it 
-1,I could not recommend this place We pulled up to the drive thru at pm and the guy behind the speaker said just go ahead with your order with the most unpleasant tone When I asked if I could have just a sec he replied again in an unpleasant tone well we close in mins So clearly they didn t want our business and something tells meet they won t want yours Save your time and go elsewhere 
-1,Manager is horrible system was down had an employee at the register adding the amount wrong and when we asked to speak to the manager she called the police because she would not serve us after we got upset that her only response was system was down and what the employee said was correct not even verifying his calculations were valid McDonalds was old school at this point writing orders on a notepad I understand their is miscommunication but ho
-1,Sign on door says drive thru open hrs and there is signage under the McDonald s M by the street that says open hrs They are NOT hrs they open at The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details Need to fix their information 
-1,Absolutely the slowest service I ve ever had at a fast food restaurant Me and my friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals After minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food There was one person working fries one cook on manager assisting the cook and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the After seeing that customers who ordered minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que So he had no idea what any of us ordered We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us minutes later All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty All the employees including the manager didn t even look years old They were definitely under trained mis managed and probably under staffed 
-1,They re telling everyone in the drive they to come inside but they are making all people waiting in line wait til they take and make a couple orders Been waiting at least minutes they ve helped a total of people Kiosks are all t
-1,Wow just wow Incredibly under staffed wich may have led to EXTREME rudeness Out of or simply didnt want to put out the effect of giving straws cup holder and ketchup And when asked for these items straight out nasty about it This mcdonald s is in parking lot of my hotel so really convenient but will NOT be revisiting If only stars was a option 
-1,Was awful waited mins for food in a half empty place not what I d call fast food then the big mac was luke warm

-1,The cashier servers look miserable and when you smile they just straight up look at you like youre vermin to them They lack personality and they rudely say stuff Even forgot items out of my order Went up and got the wrong reciept printed and recieved attitude from the cashier who printed out my reciept 
-1,Place was rude Ate there twice and this morning lady for mad and purposely messed up the coffees won t go back
-1,Over priced why because they re the biggest shame on this company poor service and worst the food was disgusting got orders wrong HOW was ordered via screen
-1,I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet O Fish fish or they re not offering the for but that s okay they re not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread the Fish so I guess they had to cut cost somewhere when they charge you for fish and don t put anything on it I won t go back Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that ll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly
-1,Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids No line ordered at kiosk right away workers and no one working Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working minutes to get egg McMuffins at am Worst service ever
-1,Another experience I was asked to wait at drive thru No other customers were in queue They forgot about me The order was reduced without telling me The apple pies were removed without any explanation When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn t identify herself She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn t provide it Bad experience with the food too The fries were so over salted I couldn t eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen End to end bad experience Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff I waited at the drive thru order kiosk then at the payment window and then at the pick up window Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait Her response was I just put on the headset Seriously that was her response There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service Why didn t she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness NOT LOVING IT Visited again on and had the same experience Even the white shirt manager ignored me 
-1, hours if you drive maybe advertises as lobby open am am however is closed to the public more often than its open with no explanation of why the doors are locked but drive through is open and employees will just watch you through the window terrible service
-1,Please calibrate The Soda s Machine correctly He has been mixing and preparing sodas wrong for days
-1,This location is incredible It has two stories Has automated machines to order from You can get a variety of different items to try out that aren t at regular McDonald s It s always super busy here too so expect a wait I m a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza I was so sick for the next three days that I couldn t leave bed Never again 
-1,Paid for nuggets by time I walked all the way to my apartment approximately minutes and we started to eat we opened up the food no nuggets
-1,The worst McDonald s in the area I have lived close to this McDonald s for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable Also the team members and management just don t seem to care I m not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant however this last visit has really ticked me off I couldn t even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent and then she wanted to act like she couldn t hear me Other times I have visited this location I have had an issue where items were left off my order so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items it would all be cold I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly items With that said I will not be back to this McDonald s location ever 
-1,Forgot to put the sign we are closed 
-1,Severely understaffed for such a busy location I ve seen McDonald s with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something 
-1,Took more than minutes in drive thru with cars ahead of me Not only the slowest McDonalds ever but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to 
-1,Ordered cheeseburgers with no pickles I got burgers with no cheese and pickles The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if you d like So if you like Russian Roulette this might be the McDonalds for you 
-1,McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service Not sure what s hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative Chick fil A this is why I love you so much 
-1,If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room 
-1,Worlds worst McDonald s Went there on may th at approximately pm pizza was closed play are arcade closed ordered food to eat in tables dirty asked several times to get it cleaned and to get better in had to stand on a line for minutes to get my drink because they wouldn t bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care
-1,This is the worst run McDonald s I have EVER seen in my life the service is super slow Its complete chaos The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff I would rate it zero but that wasn t an option 
-1,If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight The employee manager handling the front end was the rudest individual I ve ever met of all my visits to McDonald s in my years Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food One lady said she d been waiting on her food for over an hour They wouldn t even accommodate her with a refund Infact my order took min to fill The store shut down the kiosks as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby I understand it s easy to get overwhelmed but when you re filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour your prioritizing methods are failing And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers I m on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again But if I were a local they would have just received their last from my pocket My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald s in down town orlando the management lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty McDonald s I d fix this ladies attitude or I d find her replacement 
-1,I have no idea how the employees got hired They are so rude and have no manners They literally see you standing there for over minutes waiting and no one offers to help They all need to stay home if they don 
-1,Drive thru minutes to get to screen to order Then no one to take order for another minutes Can t get out of line Trapped Such slow service Sort of silly for this newly updated McDonald s to be poorly run or staffed 
-1, min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn t have someone who can take my order Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake International Driveway to busy for this time of the day They need more personal 
-1,I wish there were warning signs on the drive in Turn back now unless you have minutes to wait in the drive thru to order pay and receive your food Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you you are stuck Hopefully you don t want any Coke with your meal And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional minutes on to your wait Haven t even tasted my food yet Do not recommend 
-1,Service and costumer service awful horrible 
-1,Took forever which I ve gotten used too being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive But the service and order quality has been way less that satisfactory more times than I could count And not to forget neither of my kids of my kids even got the Pokemon toy or any toy for that matter that they asked for 
-1,Absolute worse McDonalds I ve ever been to Restrooms were a mess ordered food gave up after minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order 
-1,Was awful at this location FILTHY Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table The self pay was out of order took minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay with only other customers in the restraunt Even while patio obviously designed patio was horrendous Trash everywhere spilled drinks on every table Very sad since this location I m sure sees a lot of visitors 
-1,Terrible service Poorly run out of kiosks were down for ordering This was the only option to order at pm at night on a Sat Place was very busy no cashiers on the line Took a number for food to be delivered Called receipt to pick up order at counter Order wrong Forgot Cookie and drink cup Had to go back up to ask for it Counter person did not apologize I will never come back here

-1,I could have gave stars if it stayed original I liked the safari jungle vibe I went with my girlfriend on July th at night time It wasn t crowded and surprised that they renovated and got rid of golden women bathroom 
-1,Arrived starving from water park minutes after ordering large order of food no deals on that was on other branches still no food so asked staff who said would look into it minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of meals and desserts saying rest coming hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize Will never be back If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service 
-1,I couldn t tell you much about the food or service because it wasn t open Supposedly hour location but closed for maintenance The sign had been updated closed from pm to am and then changed again to am I gave up hope at am when it didn t look like it was going to happen Oh well good luck 
-1,Went new year s Eve and was a disaster employees in the heart of tourist district We ordered at Kiosk and waited mins and saw that others that had been There for mins hadn t even paid for much less gotten their food Would have just done as much good to have shut the doors and locked as opposed to being open 
-1,This Mc Donald s it s always really slow Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever I m already waiting minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing It already happened sometimes I will not come back to this Mc Donald s anymore Terrible customer service 
-1,Sat in the drive thru for minutes before being able to order Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line Two other cars followed suit so we couldn t even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call
-1,Unbelievably poor service Ordered items bagged immediately but then waited mins for final item a double cheeseburger By this time first items cold so asked for a fresh re order mins later Walked out with barely an apology Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel Avoid if you can don t expect if you cannot 
-1,Normally visit this location out of days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early am On the frappe machine is down for cleaning at am and now on the system is completely down It s becoming a place that isn t dependable 
-1,What a horrible experience I sat at the front counter for over mins for utensils and sauce on Dec st at pm The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad 
-1,Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens He asked his manager to check She straight out refused We couldn t even complete one of our orders minutes after placing our other order we received fries so cold when I went up to the front to get fresh ones I didn t even have to say anything One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence The bathrooms were nasty the tables were dirty every trash can was over flowing and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando 
-1,What a waste of time we were there in line for more than minutes The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct We spent minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut The manager said she put the order together from the receipt He stated the order screen only holds orders for minutes Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another 
-1,Horrible service stood there for minutes trying to pay for my food Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others workers were in back play fighting Drive through line was around the building and over customers in line After minutes asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by register she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds 
-1,We shouldn t even be waiting for fast food more than minutes For order of chicken nuggets Please Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks I mean i know fast food isn t easy but damn minutes really give me a break Staff is extreamly slow Won t be back 
-1,How hard is it to give us the unsweetened tea we ordered instead of sweet tea We got on the hwy took the first sip and realized the ineptitude of the staff Too late to turn around 
-1,Waited minutes in the drive thru and then they started turning cars away Would ve loved to go somewhere else but the options were sparse at AM Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service 
-1,Horrible food bag the chicken sandwich came in had a disgusting almost like a gasoline smell and the sandwich was not warm at all and the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting around for a very good amount of time I threw it away immediately and spit out the bite I had in my mouth disgusting disappointing and I stopped visiting the McDonald s on hwy Cantonment because of bad food and sloppy service and this one on pine forest rd Pensacola will be on my McDonald s never to visit too 
-1,Waited in line for mins to get to order and they said that everything was broken and were taking cash only Nice I wasn t even mad just disappointed 
-1,I d like to start off by saying so far I love the employees they have great attitudes they act professional and real kind So I stop by almost every morning and have come to realize their apples pies are often hard as a rock This is becoming to be a real problem at this location They also don t put the best by stickers on them I 
-1,If I could give this less than star I absolutely would I spent minutes in line just to get meals and ice creams for my kids Waited minutes just to pay and another to get our food Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone The sad part I didn t have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered 
-1,Warning avoid this location at all costs Truly one of the worst McDonald s in the nation There s always an issue in the drive through there s always an issue when you go inside the store The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the ruled is Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald s conference in Orlando Florida If I could give them negative stars I would When you go through the drive through there is not a proper greeting It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order There is no quality service It s all about quantity instead of quality 
-1,Employees I dealt with were rude When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong The girl went to the back and came back with the right order didn t say anything or make eye contact just handed me the bag This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment fast food or not I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald s than deal with what I had to deal with 
-1,Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald s Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at pm waited and waited drive through backed up people inside waiting absolute chaos Finally at pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave Literally minutes for coffee Horrible experience short staffed and totally out of control

-1,Just went through the drive thru young lady at payment window needs additional training on what is considered proper customer care She was having a full on conversation with a coworker related to a personal matter candy she had sitting on the counter next to her the other coworker indicated she had a customer to which she stated I dont care She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished Never said hello or thank you Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease I should have driven a quarter mile up the road to Wendys Shameful

-1,WORST MCDONALD S EVER unfortunately I cannot leave less then star They have automatic screens to place your order from but only if you want breakfast cant order lunch from them A completely waste of my time and money Your better off going across the street to Burger King and getting a whopper 
-1,The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn t give it ZERO we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald s because the counter line was too long Come to find out it s because the kiosks weren t taking payment I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food When I asked for a refund for my friend s food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than mins and said it s coming Uh no Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonald s

-1,It took minutes for them to make double cheeseburgers I asked the manager Daniel why he said they just completed a large online order I told him this was the nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say Terrible location regardless of how busy it is it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty dirty tables and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude 
-1,Seriously you have one job Ordered a stake egg and cheese on a bagel they served it on a biscuit Ordered a egg McMuffin served a Sausage egg McMuffin Best part about it A MANAGER walked it out to my car Y

-1,No inside seating Rude employees that barely noticed I was there No napkins in my bag and no one asked or seemed to care if I needed any I had to remind them my meal came with a drink 
-1,Very poor minutes of waiting on my order to be wrong and it was sitting on the back counter the whole time Didn t say anything because I knew I hadn t ordered what was on the tray Employees only wanted to do one thing and passing the buck to someone else The kiosks don t work properly The line to get your money is quick enough but the wait is ridiculous Only words of English amongst the whole crew Thand you I sorry Come again Wel here are more for you Never Again 
-1,No card acepted Have men 
-1,This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter THEN they only brought of our order Forgot our McCafe drinks and condiments Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter he was told to ask someone else Really You want hr for this I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn

-1,Worst McDonald s experience ever Silent mins in drive thru When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately When finally making to window to pay they couldn t find my order For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando they completely failed the meaning of fast food 
-1,Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my year old is allergic to many things This morning around am when asked the very standard may I see the food allergy menu or since that wasn t available would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables floors and bathrooms Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite Black Friday or not absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company Zero stars would not recommend 
-1,Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must haven t been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns Never will stop there again

-1,Really poor level of service Waited over mins for a quarter pounder 
-1,I want to give this place stars the self ordering system is inefficient and way more confusing than it has to be and staff is unprepared Not their fault They need training but as is right now it s awful Took us an hour and a half to get two meals Ridiculous

-1,Employees just talk amongst themselves not fulfilling orders or payments as we sit in the driveways like dummies waiting for a bag of cold food Thanks guys all times different days and times 
-1,Cold food expensive to take advantage of the tourists and poor service
-1,For a prime busy tourist filled location the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible Many of the self ordering machines do not work when you use a normal line with a cashier it s like the employees have never even been to a McDonald s before as they don t even know the menu items I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal so it wasn t pasta or some sandwich that only special locations have When you order at a kiosk you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream Then you wait minutes to find out they don t have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one which she doesn t know how to do so you end up paying for a cup of ice cream I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn t believe it took that long Don t bother going here it s not worth it unless you want to feel like you re waiting at Disney at a subpar place 
-1,Can t even take an order correctly Couldn t repeat the order back or even put it on the screen for us to review 
-1,Waiting for someone to take my order minutes later told to use the screen no thanks I don t work for mcdonalds Im the one with the money making the purchase I appreciate the option of the screen should there be a long line but for me to fiddle through all that garbage because no one can take the order no thanks there are far too many other options out there bye mcdonalds no loss 
-1,Very slow service took over minutes to get two coffee s and cakes despite there being hardly any customers Also restroom s were dirty 
-1,Waited min for a qtr pounder at am only to witness a worker scrape the onions off my burger with her bare hands I asked for a new burger she argued that I didn t see her do this absolutely unacceptable
-1,My fries where overcooked hard and greasy and the manager who brought our food to us spilled my drink on me never compensated I will not be returning By far the worst McDonald s I ever been to your team is only as good as your team leader and this place has a very bad team leader
-1,You can not get service at the front counter They only cater to drive thru and kiosk Past weeks have stopped and after mins no one would take order after having mgr look at you

-1,This place is really clean but the service was awlful my food was cold n they don t HV a dollar menu 
-1,Very over priced but did bump into my nan so we did have a good catch up about Corrie but there is a much better place near BURGER KING The straws are thicker and the drinks are cooler I would of gave macdonalds stars but the old women in front of me how took mins and seconds to decide Yes I counted Drew the final straw

-1,Took mins to pick up my mobile order ppl working there and nobody knows where my order was When I got it it s already cold 
-1,I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar McDonald s just needs to take down this deal It seems as if every McDonald s I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties

-1,I get off work late made it to the McDonald s by pm had to sit for almost minutes before finally someone answered me then promptly told me they were closed I asked if I had it correct that they close at midnight she said it is midnight I said oh that s weird my watch phone and car clock all say I got here at and by the time I got to talk to someone it was still only and she just told me to leave that they were closed There was also other cars behind me that I assume she turned down also I understand real restaurants not wanting to seat people so close to closing but my drive through order would ve only taken minutes tops and I still would ve been gone before onald s is 
-1,I received a red raw Quarter Pounder at this location on The order taker did not understand me when I said I had a mobile order code Though the contents of my order were accurate my burger tasted weird and when I looked I observed it to be actually raw The photo below is unfiltered and unretouched It s upside down because I tossed it that way in my plate It was terrifying I called immediately and was requested to come back with my receipt which the manager did refund JUST the burger part of my order I really can t get over it Just a word of warning before you go to this particular location It was disgusting and disastrous

-1,I ordered and CLEARLY STATED that I wanted two sandwiches four hash browns and two ice coffees They only put me for one coffee I told them I ordered two so they charge me for the other coffee I ask for my extra coffee they were confused and said that they ordered me an extra sandwich so they had to fix that and refund me and gave me my nd coffee I finally thought It was fixed so when I left and got to my destination I realize this INUTILE a cashier only ordered me one hash brown instead of four Moral of the story McDonalds either train your cashiers right or buy new equipment because a simple order shouldn t have taken me more that minutes of my day KS MER 
-1,Didn t get my breakfast order right because apparently no one on their morning shift staff can count to three I can at least count to one which is the amount of stars I m giving this location 
-1,Cashier couldn t understand me and when asking about an item they had on the board she said they didn t have that No please no thank you Order was not quite right as it often isn t Nobody follows instructions Please retrain staff

-1,Did the drive thru today approx am the drive through attendant who I can only describe as a heftier young man was rude when I asked for a burger in my daughter happy meal Not to mention I specifically asked for no onions Not paying attention to my order on the screen I drove up only to find the lady trying to hand me large ice teas in addition to my regular order Confirmed on the receipt that I was charged I was not willing to wait for further fumbling about for I said don t worry about it dont want the teas and don t care about the I get home AND MY DAUGHTER S HAMBURGER IS OVERFLOWING WITH ONIONS Terrible customer service terrible attention to detail terrible experience

-1,Got breakfast from this place today and found mold in my orange juice Feel so gross
-1,Post renovation this place sucks The kiosks are worthless because you spend extra time filling in things about your order that are self serve anyway And the order comes out wrong anyway Also have boys and instead of explaining there are no boy toys they just throw girl toys in instead Also No sauce dispensers Now gotta open tons of packets Down hill for sure 
-1,I just paid for a hard fish sandwich cold fries At least they didn t scr
-1,Its really annoying that Google does not seem to let you report an Unknown Closed I do not know if the location is permanently closed All I know is that I visited on Sept and there store and some of the surrounding parking was blocked off with fencing the store did not seem to be conducting business and there seemed to be some dumpsters and signs of demolition No indication of nature or duration of the closure Hence cannot say if its permanent But they seem like they may be closed for a while No notice beforehand from staff or signs 
-1,Every single time I have gone through the drive thru at this location it has taken at least minutes to complete the transaction They have a sauce they re advertising on a poster at the drive through that says Honey sauce but when you get to the window no one knows what you re talking about Anyhow the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we won t be returning to this location Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our my husband and I s nuggets aren t done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait That s fine as we do so without complaint The manager comes out minutes later to give us our food We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich and not piece nuggets That s not what we paid for or ordered We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window as I heard them yelling to him They want to talk to you countless times as if he asked out of frustration and anger After he was torn away from the slow work he wasn t helping with while in his office he pretended he didn t understand what I said and said he couldn t write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didn t have some kind of coupon book I asked him if he could give us what we bought next time since we had already paid He said yes and we left Yesterday was the last day we visited this location and we asked for the manager at the first pay window He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our piece nuggets that we were buying He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it You would think how much revenue McDonalds brings in the manager wouldn t be so stingy and would apologize and provide what s necessary to remediate the situation He acted so snide and unapologetic too Needless to say experiencing slow service disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities we won t be returning 
-1,The worst possible McDonald s in the eastern side when ever I go to get breakfast im always either missing something or my order is never taken correctly and the ice cream machine is either being washed or Is broken at pm they either wash the machine early so they can leave early and the crew there is just terrible they never seem to have anything

-1,We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it Now it s just a boring modern McDonald s with bleh service The remodel was a mistake and if you re going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves Probably won t come back during our zoo trips anymore 
-1,I received my take out spending My fries were mix old fries My original chicken combo meat and bun was burnt I try to call no answer Couldn t return
-1,Unreal this mcdonalds is garbage It was cool when it had zoo themed but came back home to visit to find my favorite mcdonalds right off the highway near the new tarnished Service is always lackluster at best and usually can be very messy inside since the remodel
-1,The McDonald s buy the zoo pictures say it all Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables trash overflowing Don t even go in the bathrooms yikes There wasn t a clean table in the whole place Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost minutes Had I walked around and noticed the mess we would have left As I m writing this I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner Don t eat here unless you want to get Ebola
-1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE More than not order is wrong in some way Fries are always soggy just UGH 
-1,Worst McDonald ever The workers are really rude don t know how to work take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you I waited for them to give me my coke for around minutes and when they finally hand it to me it was a Dr pepper guess what I waited minutes more for them to have the decency to
-1,After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week we stopped off at this McDonald s location to get us a late night dinner I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies sad face As we pulled away from the drive thru and continued on our way to our final destination we realized that they gave us the wrong order We spent about but only received maybe worth of food The lobby was closed the line was long and we were too tired to turn back I tried calling this location more than times and even submitted a complaint help request via the McDonald s app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts 
-1,They have destroyed their animal themed building and now it s boring Not worth going to anymore Why are McDonald s creating such boring buildings What a waste of money It doesn t make sense It s as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away 
-1, st time today I Asked for cappuccino without sugar they gave with sugar nd time asked cappuccino they mentioned that they are not able to do because of machine cleaning Also most of people on the drive though window don 
-1,We bought food and drinks with the kids After playing in the play place we tried to get refills on our sodas and were told they do not offer refills and we would have to buy another There were no signs or anything stating such and I ve never seen another McDonald s telling people this so I m pretty sure the worker just lied to us 
-1,Worst McDonald s ever sat in the drive thru for over minutes while the first drive thru the orders were being attended and the second drive thru was ignore and I finally drove up to place the order and my order was wrong like always worst experience ever bad management 
-1,Person taking orders at drive thru was super rude and very unprofessional Can t believe workers are not getting trained to be professional I think person was drugged up 
-1,IM SO FREAKING UPSET WHY WOULD YALL TAKE AWAY THE ZOO ANIMALS RUINED MY CHILDHOOD IM SO SAD ACTUALLY SAD I CANNOT BELIEVE YALL WOULD REPLACE SUCH A GLORIOUS FUN PLACE WITH SUCH A BORING BLOCK OF A BUILDING R I P MY HAPPINESS HEART SHATTERED 
-1,I can t believe they took away all the amazing animals and put in a Modern Farmhouse McDonald s The previous McDonald s was iconic This new renovation just looks like every other new McDonald s nothing unique about it 
-1,BE AWARE There was a MAN that looked weird He asked me for money and my boyfriend for a cigarette then he wouldn t leave us ALONE until I said I was calling the cops The place is cool because of the decorations but The burger was greasy disgusting French fries NOT fully cooked One of the workers was not even wearing an hat She messed up the order and behind me there was another Lady mad due to a wrong order
-1,If you want to watch employee s fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you Service between am horrible and the pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave Very Childish and unpleasant employee s 
-1,horrible service I waited there for minutes and they never attended me how horrible I will never come again
-1,They or rude and order was wrong food was cold When I ask for hot food the employee was upset and said she s about to complain about her food your right because I paid my money for it yes and for her to be so rude no customer service at all who really over this place no one could just allow y
-1,Extremely hot in play area even after renovation Customer service not good French fries are not fresh 
-1,I visit this place often but after witnessing the tall guy in a manager uniform one day doing a drug exchange in the parking lot would rather not bring my kids here to witness this type of thing the owner should be ashamed of themselves for allowing drugs
-1,Newly removed You would think this place would be better Yuck it s worse My bread on my Big Mac was moldy and my chick
-1,Boycotting until McDonald s corporate corrects the issue and brings all the animals back at this location If they only knew that was why peopl
-1,Normally every experience I ve had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees weren t in the best mood Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again The staff very unwilling to help over hearing a conversation with another customer a Hispanic father and young daughter trying to pick up a order and knowing very little English the employee being rude and acting like she couldn t understand Just plain old being disrespectful that my husband had t
-1,Apparently when ordering counter pickup after or they don t allow you to and gotta go through drive through
-1,Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over minutes now they need to get better service 
-1,The App let s you order breakfast and pay ahead but when you show up and it s their system won t let them complete your order The location is relatively good the employees are always friend and fast But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office app devs and need to either decide to prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the shut off or allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order minutes after it s no longer breakfast time I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at on the way to work 
-1,Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds
-1,The food was good but only stall for going to the restroom
-1,I can t believe how rude this people is 
-1,Rude staff complaining about us sitting at a table All because they don t want to do their job Should of

-1,Used to be a fun place to go to but everything has changed
-1,Gave me wrong order She doesn 
-1,So I got to this location frequently despite hearing the horror stories about this location because it is close to me Well tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it First I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w Cheese Tea for the drink make the combo a large So the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink and he tells me that I ordered it wrong I said Well normally when I come here they default to sweet tea I said that because they usually do He said Nah That s not how we do it Then he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese sweet tea and make the combo a large I saw that it was not right on the screen but he repeated the order to me correctly I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double The person at the window talked to the person who took my order and he came to the window and yelled I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED I told him that I said double several times when I ordered times to be exact He person who took my order who looked to be a manager yelled at me NO IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea He finally told me that he would make it order but I did not trust him at this point so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back This was an awful experience and I will not be back I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over years 
-1,Worst and slowest McDonald s I ve ever been 
-1,Never get my order correct always something missing 
-1,Line is ridiculous They need new and faster workers

-1,First I only added the star because that s the only way to do a review I had drinks so full they were spilling through the lids the woman at the window saw it spilling and still passed while they were dripping guessing she saw a look on my face this woman looked me in my face and said it s just a little bit and closed the window so I she came back to the window with half of my order my son opened his cheese burger and looks like a arm hair a eyebrow or puuuuub maybe I asked for napkins she gave me sooo many napkins I m like you should ve fix this before you gave it to me i worst of the worst experience 
-1,Rudest night crew I ve ever experienced The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers

-1,Worst people ever The girls were being rude for no reason The zoo theme outside is very nice but the customer service was the worst We asked a question and she slammed the window on us
-1,Wow Today I went through the drive thru The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper When I pulled forward to the food pickup window I informed them and requested my receipt It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card I waited additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared I brought to their attention about the overcharge They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone I have been calling the entire day No answer 
-1,Zari was absolutely incompetent We specifically ordered meals to be placed in separate bags during the first stage of ordering as they were for people When we requested this again at her window she rolled her eyes huffed and began changing them out She also gave me Cokes and diet Coke for the diabetic in the group They didn t mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health 
-1,Well what can I say I use to work mc Donalds and their custermer service was great I went to drive through tonight no one help me on the speaker so I drove to the window the cashier tell no that will need to go back in line and order again that he could get my order at the window I was in line for good mn then I go to the window to talk to manger nothing and he just left to the back and ignored the custermer in the front he was asking for him to get him something he did not get any help he left I drove up then he was not there at all with a big line I went back to the drive thru and well to oder then he tel their is no ice scream so I get inline again for nothing had to stay in line until they served every one in front and again no one in the windows to help but just the some need to ck cause I have it all in video I will posting it on line to she how horrible custermer service Mc Donald s have compare to Chick fil A they don t come close of the quality and custermer service they have and people need to start speaking about Mc how not only tge drive thru people wait for to mn some all the pollution but that s another story I hope this makes some ck this out
-1,Went today after the zoo it was a very bad experience to say the least We were given over seasoned fries one straw for three drinks and the drinks were all bad I thought how do you mess up a drink It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits I mean really sour The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids Will not ever return 
-1,Doesn t deserve one star Waited in line minutes When we finally ordered the girl couldn t get the order right after attempts When we got to the pay window the girl was talking on her cell phone When I asked her to repeat my order she looked at me crazy When we got our order it was disgusting Soggy oily fries burned chicken nuggets water down soda plain disgusting They need new management for sure Someone please contact corporate 
-1,These teenagers with bad customer service have the worst attitudes and are lazy I bet the hiring manager is the same way considering her terrible hires I wouldn t give this place one star The only good person I 
-1,I ordered a piece nuggets and chocolate chip cookies I got my nuggets and had to wait minutes for the cookies I had to call and let them know I was still waiting in reserve 
-1,I was disappointed that the play area was closed due to it being filthy and the speakers were blown so the animal noises were bursts of LOUD static 
-1,Worst experience ever I pay for large fries and only fill it half way I said if I want a medium I ll pay for a medium Now fill this up or give me my money back Service is just the worst I ve seen I really recommend people to not go there Waste of time and will leave you with a headache
-1,My wife and I was going to this McDonald s for some morning when they had another crew But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew an old man a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude This crew need to be removed They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner This facility is also made where you can t just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives We will be skipping visiting the morning crew Plz change crew or train them better 
-1,Would have have it a negative if possible I have went to this location for the last time Drive through you will sit at the speaker for minutes before they even say anything to you but you can hear them talking laughing and cursing to each other POOR MANAGEMENT THEN my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about streks of ink on it nothing legible SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn t effect her If you are going to the Dallas Zoo drive further and don t let this McDonald s ruin your day TRUST ME 
-1,Horrible place rude employees burnt fries and fudge sundae had fudge all over top and outside of plastic top 
-1,Be careful with young children here We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited We asked her to leave several times because it was very uncomfortable She just continued to sit and stare at my neice We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave Then the women s boyfriend called her back to his table she left us and then they walked out shortly after Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe When we left they were parked next to our truck as well We will definitely not be going back there 
-1,Dirty Dirty Dirty We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed Every table in the play place was awful Ours had spilled milk The employee took one trash can out but didn t pick up the trays and didn t clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk
-1,Terrible for getting rid of the zoo decor 
-1, Deserves No Stars What So Ever This Place Is By Far The Worst The drive threw lady on was absolutely rude I came to get some breakfast around she continusly kept asking me is that it I asked for a minute to see the menu Then within a Second she asked if I was done with my order Sausage burritos had No Sausage Orange Juice Cups Were Only Filled Half Way Hash browns were cold By far the worst service ever Your management needs to work on their employees attitudes 
-1,The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it I would expect better seeing is how it

-1,This mc donalds is very slow and the employees are rude and always have an attitude when you ask to get your order fresh I always count on this mc donalds not to mess up with my order but they ALWAYS do Also they tell you to wait on the or waiting spot but never come out with your food Today i ordered chicken nuggets and asked for them to be fresh they were ok until i noticed that the chicken was BLACK inside one of the nuggets Maybe was black inside of more of them and i didnt notice I have picture proof as well This mc donalds is just trash 
-1,Very Disappointed minutes to get my food due to short of staff per shift leader No manager to get my money refunded I ve waited in the drive thru No apology whatsoever from that shift leader Will call coporate office myself My order was all screwed up 
-1,The drive thru took forever and it was p The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full mins Doesn t sound ridiculous until you re sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy s credit card and started laughing about it His co worker was shaking her head saying it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long To add insult to injury I got my food I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered I left and my food was cold and my order was wrong 
-1,Horrible service I m just done with McDonald s I tried a few different locations and apparently none of them can offer a friendly service i will just take my money somewhere else 
-1,A worker called MY order number so obviously I m gonna grab it It didn t even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren t charged for that after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged Ten minutes later they ve manned to give two BIG orders but haven t managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she s telling a worker she gave us hash browns I obviously heard her and said no ma am we got this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them At this point I m pissed I ve been accused of not paying for my part of the food I m hungry I ve waited way too long the manager has an attitude AND she s a accusing my family of eating hash browns in less than a minute NEVER eating at this McDonald s again Especially with a manager like that 
-1,I eat at this McDonalds at least times a week Never again The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not Had to wait at drive thru order full minutes before giving my order That s at the speaker not in line Was told rather rudely to wait several times When given the order the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared When I got to work I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware no syrup or butter and not even a napkin Calls placed to the store went unanswered Poor service all around 
-1,Worst experience ever They closed the lobby early Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job 
-1, pm I came by McDonalds today and I went through the drive through the girl that takes your order did not even bother to Greet me and take my order she was just talking so much I guess she did not know she was gossiping and knew we can hear her but she was saying the most rudest things through speaker it seems like she was talking to another employer I kept saying helloo hellooo helloo and did not even bother to stop talking Then when I pulled up to the first window the one that was so rude was the one that has a ring in her nose she is african american she did not even bother to repeat my order and did not offer to give me receipt There was another girl next to her biting off her Acrylic Nails and was falling all over the table where the order computer were at SO DISGUSTING I used to work here things have changed and these ghetto girls are so RUDE At the pick up window that lady was so sweet she had a smile and greated us well

-1,I never leave reviews but I had to here Honestly if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last I spent an hour in the drive thru and when I got to the window it took minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest in what they were doing It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion it was a sight to see Then when I finally did get my food the order it was of course not correct But the weird thing is they didn t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but 
-1,DO NOT GO As soon as I got in I got yell at by one of their employees to get out and go to through the drive thru I told her I did not have a car and she told me to wait in the line anyways I standed in the line for cars and they took forever to make any orders After my order was done they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car The two cars behind me had bigger orders I am talking delivery bags They yelled at me they basically threw the food at me and I left with the worst experience Is not fast food if you have to wait minutes just to order

-1,They need to shut down this Mc Donald or sell it to a different management Worst service ever 
-1,The young ladies that work during the day are too busy chit chatting and texting and making the coffees wrong Cashier at the drive thru window literally handed me my receipt with her head down and other hand texting Very irritated that I paid for two coffees and it wasn t until I reached my next destination that I realized that they were made completely wrong Ladies making the coffee were talking and laughing and didn t say hello or thank you Very rude 
-1,Update updating to stars Was at the drive through for over mins today Cars were leaving the line bc it wasn t moving Got on the lane and no one came to the speaker I left Customer Service is terrible Starting from when you get to the ordering screen Drive thru employees never greet you never thank you they look tired and moody There is one or two exceptions I did look at the name badge because I was surpri
-1,Disgusting as always I think they pre make the burgers a day ahead the bread cheese and the patty is old fries fells still frozen lol or they wish to be frozen
-1,They served a bucket of stale oil instead of a clean batch of fries and a filet o fish The patty was stale hard possibly refried and the oil quality was very poor The fried weren t fresh but sometimes this happens with door dash But the quality of the oil and the staleness of the food was unreal Regret not making the choice for pizza tonight could even eat this food

-1,Do NOT go to this McDonald s if you re in a hurry We were just picking up a drink so it wasn t a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting min for his chicken sandwich He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said man you can see we busy Also note that this was the only McDonald s we encountered in Florida that doesn t offer any size soft drinks 
-1,Terrible establishment Slow af Incredibly long lines Waited in line for minutes I m the drive thru for them to tell me they aren 
-1,Staff are busy talking and they don t care about customers And they make us wait for long time at drive through all the time When I called at the store they picked up the call But when I start complain about this situations they hung up on my face This McDonald used to be so good and professional I don t know what happened since they changed to new staff got worse 
-1,Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted Then look surprised when I told her The manager should not let her work drive thru Which explains why the line was so long I m sure I m not the only order she screwed up Don t normally post these comments but it s becoming more of the norm these days 
-1,This McDonald s needs to close I ve ordered times in months and had correct order Don t order delivery go yourself and check the bag before you leave 
-1,no stars this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered minutes in the drive thru I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food I ask the manager for her name and she walks away at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday around pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have cars in the drive thru
-1,They have the worst manger ever One of them have a lack of speaking which is Arlene Ledesma She doesn t know what is being said to her You can t get your point across because she won t understand Can t handle the customers and she s very disrespectful 
-1,I live feet away and waited an hour to place an order This is supposed to be fast food Never had a more disappointed experience with McDonald 
-1,Biscayne Blvd and th Street Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive thru window with employees one who couldn t even understand or speak English I made a complaint to McDonald s yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner s organization The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski CEO of McDonald s as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald s in Chicago They need to understand why McDonald s is doing so poorly afterall when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service I will not be going to this or any other McDonald s again It was that bad McDonald s corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers The owner clearly must put numbers before people Horrible horrible experience Will stick with Wendy s instead They have much better food and service As a follow up to my complaint to McDonald s and the CEO I did receive a written response and phone call Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonald s I will add that although I had been to this McDonald 
-1,For the third time in the morning this is happened to me the drive through lady does not answer I drove around the front this morning and they had about four employees there looking at me One of them gave me a thumbs up to go back to the drive through which I did and it was the same result the lady did not answer and finally I decided I would leave and right before I left she answered by saying one moment please so I waited hey moment and she still was not ready so I just left There have been two vehicles in the drive through before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience I believe the employees are slacking off in the morning which is difficult for me because if I don t have breakfast then I have to wait hours at work before they allow me to go eat

-1,So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonald s in regards to what I m doing doordash Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people 
-1,Really rude staff too bad service Avoid if you can There are so many other better places to eat or drink around They would literally cheat you 
-1,Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location we couldn t eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by I understand they can t help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonald s location then you should definitely avoid this location 
-1,This plave is not a good place They used to have blacks there too Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race I though McDonald s was equal opportunity employer Guess not Today I went there to use the restroom I was told I couldn t use the restroom unless I bought something I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way I asked to speak to the manager the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I ll be in and out that s all I need it and I was still denied Every time I come to this place is always something Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait to minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her I wasn t really strong with expressing myself oh now I express myself a little bit more I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn t a nice place to be I wouldn t give them a dime of my money When did they treat people and I ve always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald s along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald s down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty disrespectful unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California Let s get back together McDonald s or else I ll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it s like this McDonald s We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they ve had experiences at McDonald s that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who ve walked out of McDonald s and see if they ll never come back I don t think we want this to be a topic of discussion 
-1,I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didn t even put the bacon on it The bacon that I spend my money on and now they didn t put the onion on it 
-1,Very bad exp I believe I goten bad food 
-1,if you re a tourist DON T go to McDonald s especially this one rude service poor choice worst fast food chain in US by far
-1,No dollar menu anything but drinks here Even coffee is bucks The service is spotty and confusing at best The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pier ultra poor planning on space for quality of service business There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless 
-1,Worst McDonald s in the world that s a big statement but its the only one that fits I ordered breakfast on a Saturday It wasn t too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier Save your money go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible To clarify I m not bagging on all McDonald s I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible my suggestion is to go elsewhere
-1,Got my order wrong took forever to serve my sweet tea Crispy chicken had a large piece of not so crispy chicken w the foulest tasting sauce I ll never order again watered down sodas so much you d think it was club soda Never again
-1,We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup What exactly were we supposed to do with that Meanwhile others got a decent sized cup for water What do you lose to give out a cup of WATER

-1,Worse Mac Donald s on the planet and the most discussing rudest staff I 
-1,This was an ok McDonald s but I liked going to this place because it was so busy during the summer so you are more likely to get hot and fresh food Now that it s December they are slacking I guess they are having more problems with the homeless or druggies or drug dealers outside of their business but twice in the last two weeks I got cold and half cooked fries after pm Maybe because I m a gang stalking victim this is happening REPORT ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE On December th I got the free double cheeseburger it was a cold burger a
-1,Go anywhere else Not here Beyond the counter this place is never clean Glorified truck stop Too many other options next door and nearby that are more deserving of your business Especially since the dining room is no longer open hours No drive through Sad Literally steps from the pier The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks The homeless aren t the issue It is the mentally disturbed the hustlers and questionable addicts This is not a family friendly location Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat No other business has these issues Not one Food No problems 
-1,I got a raw meat burger It was cooked outside of it But inside under the part was cooked was very raw meat That was unfit to eat And made me sick I don t prefer NO body to go eat their at all they will Kill you with uncooked meat in your burgers

-1,Good morning Please tell me if this matters or if I m being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned Maybe because I didn t have my coffee this morning I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning This morning I forgot my wallet I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than breakfast tomorrow They said so sorry No I pleaded with this new manager that I d never seen before I asked for the manager that I d spoken with on several occasions She refused to see me and he stated that her response would be the same I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us He said it would be discarded Seriously I asked So I said that you d rather throw it away then let me have it a faithful customer So my lesson is now Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson McDonalds doesn t care about my patronizing their establishment and I m going to seriously break my coffee habit No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me A lesson well learned can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded

-1,Horrible they messed up my whole order and Had to give me a refund And they over charged me
-1,Terrible
-1,Ehhhhhhhhh
-1,Terrible
-1,After decades of serving families McDonald s is on their way out I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs McDonald s needs individuals who can read comprehend and speak English Today I went there for lunch I ordered Filet o Fish sandwich meal I ended up with peice chicken nuggets Hmmmm I guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said Filet o Fish sandwich I quickly caught the error and told the cashier She said So you don t want it Then the manager came along to find out what the problem was I explained and received the sandwich I left and when I got home I found out I had a frosted breakfast pastry in a Filet o Fish box Come on now McD s May we get better service and expect a lot more from you If not please close your doors to save the public from the irritation 
-1,What can I say it s McDonalds The food is never cold or smashed It s hit or miss on the type of employee you ll get at the drive through They either don t want to be here and hate the fact that you re making them work or they smile and make you feel welcomed It s close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch I m editing my last post and changing my rating I waited in the Drive Thru for minutes with no one coming on the line The other line however three cars went through while I sat there I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around The level of unacceptable is insane I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake The day is Monday June th at pm The morning crew is a good bunch of workers however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow 
-1,If I could give zero stars I would the employees are very rude 
-1,This McDonalds is pretty hit or miss mostly miss I placed an online mobile order showed up minutes later and the lady kept me waiting for minutes until she told me they didnt have my order Didnt even try to accommodate me any other way she simply just turned me away Was pretty rude also They apparently couldn t be bothered to service a PAYING customer 
-1,The kiosks suck People can t figure out how to use them so you have to wait If you can get someone at the register they act put out I managed to skip the kiosk and had to wait longer than the people that took forever figuring out the kiosks Been here minutes and s

-1,The worst McDonald s in Austin tx
-1,I came here for a Uber eats order and their system was down and they wouldn t give me a Big Mac sauce for my customer for free because their system was down It 
-1,From my experience today they have a bad job with the drivers who do Delivery they take time to prepare the orders and when they are ready they forget to take them to the drivers and with an APOLOGY they solve it they should be more responsible that is their work like ours is to make the Delivery on time
-1,Looks like chicken nuggets bite piece served change one is not complete cooked I got terrible chicken nuggets never ever Atmosphere is bad needed more organized

-1,The worse McDonald in LA Unprofessional stuff and very unknowable manager regards to health and food handling basics After realizing that the person who was working at the fries station didn t used gloves at all and he was sticking his finger into each box he needed to fill and touched each fries in a way that is improper and already contaminated I talk to the manager to ask why the person don t wear gloves that it is requirement in the kitchen that produce prepa
-1,Drive through takes forever never any parking when you decide to go inside to place your order Kiosks have been down last couple of visits and workers pay no attention to customers even when they need to pay because of their broken kiosks not accepting payment I went inside for a soda and iced coffee and didn 
-1,Should have never got in the drive thru line no joke do Not come here it s pm been in this drive thru for over minutes sta
-1,My order is WRONG every time the most frustrating customer experience I live near this new location and have visited times since the remodel and I ve concluded that this location is a mess If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases I ask for no cheese every time and guess what is in my order CHEESE Or my frys are half full or the hashbrowns are completely missing no syrup utensils are in the bag as requested On occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order an employee brings out an incorrect order yes times Today this New team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it what the hell Every other time I let the incorrect order slide but today I decided to speak with the store manager I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders and she replies Sorry I then ask what is mcdonalds doing about this its every time the order is wrong She responds I m so sorry I ask again and same response Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it this new location is a joke its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this and its been a few months since their brand new building opened 
-1,They forgot half of my order when I called them back it was drive though the girl that worked there gave me huge attitude rolled her eyes on me and shut down the window after new moments have me my bag with NOT CORRECT ORDER still The most shocking thing was the attitude Ruined our mood Do not recommend There are plenty McDonald restaurants in the area Definitely avoiding this one Tip to owners don 
-1,The white guy at the drive thru was good and friendly The reception was right But when I got my order it was wrong I went inside to get corrected The cashier and manager had some sort of rival gang problem Instead of walking away from the problems They all started fighting It was horrible I won t ever go back there 
-1,The studio city location has the worst service of any restaurant I know of Drive thru is marginally ok but inside is chaos There are people in the kitchen who occasionally come out to the counter to reluctantly help customers No one is charge It makes me wish we had a real McDonalds nearby I left a cold order of fries on the counter because no one called out the order number Never did get my hamburger I m giving them one star because the food is fine if and when you get it 
-1,How rude of the driver thus person that worked on around pm we were wanting to get some fries and chicken nuggets and some drinks and hoping to enjoy a amazing meal from this McDonald s but we lost our appetites due to the drive thu person using a loud rude unprofessional tone the worker seemed rushed and we didn t even get our sodas due to the person being so rude Not ok 
-1,ORDERED A FILET O FISH KETCHUP ONLY 
-1,Even after they remodeled with drive thru lanes they are not equipped for it It s super slow that you can order UberEATS and still get it faster Worse McDonald s ever and slowest fast food in ever 
-1,I bit into the burger and the meat tasted funny and mushy so I cut it in half and it looked like this 
-1,Can t believe this place is brand new and the parking lot is as horrible as it is This is the worst design I ve ever seen If there are people in the Drive Thru everyone in the parking lot is trapped in the parking lot no menus no front of store employees and when you do show at the counter it s like the employees are scared to leave the kitchen like they have high anxiety of actually facing someone or something You can stand there at the counter forever and no one will ever come
-1,After sitting in the drive thru for an hour spending almost asking for sauces and getting on the highway we discovered missing large fries and no sauces We returned and received cold fries with absolutely no salt on them Others were also complaining of incomplete orders as well 
-1,Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonald s and only for two egg McMuffins Then the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches The staff definitely did not want to be there It is my closest McDonald s but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time Just avoid this spot no matter what 
-1,It took plus hours to get thru the drive thru The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out No one apologised for the abnormal wait time When I got my food the fries where cold and the taste old I usually to not complain about a restaurant but plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous Especially for a fast food establishment 
-1,This place has ZERO customer service From no one being at the front counter to long waits to get food to getting your order wrong then getting cold food when they remake your order This is one McDonald s you ll want to avoid going to 
-1,I ordered from McDonald s and I did not receive my Sausage Egg McMuffin The previous times that I have ordered from this location they have messed up my order 
-1,Rebuilt McDonald s on a lot that is way too small lane drive thru weaves through the small parking lot making it impossible to get out if you parked and ate inside 
-1,Literally the worst they literally never have working registers crazy wait times tonight they didn t have food They said they wouldn t have any food for another hr I work night shifts in the Area and they 
-1,Don t go There s another one up the street This is the worst McDonald s to ever exist It s actually not even a real McDonald s I think the franchise owner is doing their own thing here the food 
-1,Super Long line drive trough night time this place sucks what a mistake if you have minutes to spare this is your place
-1,The new location is attractive The staff member taking the orders was great but the person putting our order together gave us the wrong items We paid for an upsize and got a lesser priced size Mcdonald s french fries are outstanding the rest of what they offer is oftentimes questionable 
-1,Don t go Usually meals have been sitting around getting cold and stale before being served in drive through I even asked server to please get me fresh fries since mine were cold and her response was 
-1,Never again will I order from here times ordered mistakes were made Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order Waited minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled 
-1,We have given this newly remodeled McDonalds a few chances The only difference is they now can jam more cars in their drive thru They will still make you pull up and wait for your order and forget that you re waiting Same problem as before Having this happen multiple times seems ridiculous and we don t even frequent this place Location is convenient but not worth it 
-1,Worst place ever We had to ask to clean the table because it s was filthy Then they never served our order we waited for min and it results that my order was cancelled because breakfast time was over and no one i
-1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE I get it s only food but it s fast food We waited over thirty minutes for our food and should be called slow food We waited at the drive thru first and no one was taking orders then we went inside and had to order on the kiosk because they told us too Why h
-1,Unfortunately almost everyone that works at the Lankershim and Riverside location are so unprofessional 
-1,I had a miserable experience with this drive thru Waited mins to be told they don t have the McRib or ice cream available The wait times are ridiculously long Go anywhere else but this location 
-1,Since reopening this location suck big time Cannot get anything in time the manager here is very poorly performing no people to take orders clean up or just run this place like a restaurant 
-1,They need to change the time that they open because the door state s that they open at am but when ask employees what time they will be opening they stated that they don 
-1,Um so this is not a McDonald s 
-1,Claims to be hours but it s constantly closed I go for McFlurries so i 
-1,Avoid this drive thru youll be stuck for mins My last visits the wait times were off the charts I give up off to a different location 
-1,They get my order wrong every single time It s kind of amazing actually 
-1,They always seem to forget something in my delivery order napkins straws a whole order of fries Pay attention people Okay this time you forgot a whole hamburger I ordered a Big Mac it s on the delivery receipt but it s nowhere to be found Furthermore you sent a cookie that I didn t ask for in this order What s that a consolation prize for losing the Big Mac 
-1,Worst drive thru set up I ever experienced No way out unless you go into the drive thru line and wait 
-1,It amazing how many items you can get wrong in one order Fries were double salted yet undercooked Soda wasn t what I asked for Really just bad service from the drive thru on multiple occasions This location does not properly represent the McDonald s brand 
-1,I ve already written a review for this place and haven t been here in a bit but this is an update The girl taking payments in the first window with glasses dark hair was rude and the nuggets I had ordered weren t warm and taste as if they were sitting out for a while And to top it off they gave me an opened buffalo sauce I can 
-1,After waiting in drive through for minutes I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either and a filet of fish with no tarter sauce and of a peice of cheese I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders and when I showed them the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag I showed her the bag being empty and even made the comment Even no ketchup She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be to minutes since my lunch is only minutes I had no choice but to leave 
-1,Food was hard and cheese danishes were hard Workers forgot to give me water bottles They were just talking and seemed like they weren 
-1,Good fast service went in ange cl was awesome in da drive thru be back soon
-1,Just ordered two large drinks and two large fries Both drinks taste wonky as if the syrup in the machines are off And to top it all off they had me pull to the side to wait on TWO large fries Won t recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonald s food drinks Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks I d hate to see what else they d wreck 
-1,This location should have stayed closed Why do they have a re opening sign when they re only operating for drive thru What about the pedestrians The ones who can t drive At least I was able to walk in and order food before they remodeled I live less than a mile from here and I can t walk over and physically order food And why is there a parking lot if we can t walk in And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru You re better off going to the one on burbank Blvd Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesn t expect problems This isn t it McDonald s minutes sitting in a drive thru 
-1,I had quite possibly my worst McDonald s experience ever here After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin the order taker said ok I ll punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you Um Ok When I got the order it ONLY had egg I politely informed the person at the drive through window but they refused to correct the order saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered I d have to get back in line and place a new order What the hell I won t be coming back here 
-1,The employees just kept screaming the n word I wasn t even trying to eat here I was just walking by A
-1,The worst place in the valley Nasty personal nigth time manager it s the more inefficient person to rule a place no brain incredible how this person work in a restaurant Never comes back 
-1,All I ordered was mcribs for drive thru They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait Ended up waiting minutes before I got my order They claimed the manager couldn t find me It is a very small parking lot The manager didn t try very hard I ended up calling them to remind them about my order They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy The only explanation I got was we re so sorry I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite Lost my appetite 
-1,Bad Service Bad Attitude Gave me the wrong drink and charge me for sandwiches when I ordered one I was in a hurry to the office around AM and I didn t have time to argue When I got to second window and I was handed the bag and the window shut by someone who looked like she d rather be anywhere but there Terrible service 
-1,This McDonald 
-1,Ordered pies through doordash The bags come sealed so I know it s not the drivers fault They only put in the bag so half the order was missing Called to see what s up Christian basically told me too bad nothing I can do 
-1,This McDonald s is garbage Dirty No soda Only take orders from of the lanes Nope 
-1,TERRIBLE Got our orders wrong and when I got home it was missing my entire meal NEVER WILL I EVER RETURN HERE Manager Rosalina or Rosaline is terrible as well she is clueless and she has no idea how to repay or provide refund for this mistake She called back saying she can t do anything I m too busy I can 
-1,This place has changed for the worse in the past few months Previously well staffed with courteous people Now they don t even look at you when you place your order Not even simple please and thank you I guess the cream of the crop left and moved up Now it s staffed by stoner high school dropouts They co
-1,I was there this morning at a m thinking about ordering breakfast and coffee The woman on the intercom wasn t really friendly and did not explain to me why they were not serving breakfast at this time I thought breakfast was served throughout the day no matter what but I guess I was wrong I ve never had an issue with this McDonald s but this was a first and disappointing
-1,This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me I waited for minutes in the car and he never brought it I decided to walk in the restaurant they had the bag just laying there Why would he ask me to wait in the car if he never planned on bringing it to me Bad service 
-1,My whole order was a lost the oatmeal was not closed correctly and so all the order got wet and the oatmeal did not cook right Then they didn t even supply me with spoons I asked for cream and sugar in my coffee and they gave it to me black and they got upset because asked them please add what I had asked for in my coffee I ordered two breakfast burritos and they were cold it s frustrating how bad some employees are trained they don t have any pride on what they do nor care about service they provide is just a shame 
-1,We ordered our food It was free egg mcmuffin day and before we even sat down they brought it to us clearly it was made before we ordered It was cold in the middle They proceeded to stare whisper and laugh at us I was uncomfortable eating the food afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing 
-1,Lazy people very rude when they fall behind which is alot they dont use the register and wont help with kiosk they need new staff
-1,It took several minutes for someone to take our order then our order took forever and was wrong My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch This facility is dirty packed both inside and in the drive thru and is obviously understaffed 
-1,They got my order wrong This happens often To make things worse they are very inefficient Ordered a small fries they served other people before I got mine Seriously fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers I used to worl at McDonalds years ago and know how it should be run Horrible Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese 
-1,The staff who took our order doesn t have customer service Very impatient In fairness he is so quick taking our order and he knows his menu Sad that frappe machine doesn t work No choice as thia is the only place that s open for breakfast here at universal 
-1,I ordered a Mcdouble which was on their outside drive thru menu When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble no bacon So all they did was note NO Bacon and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble When I got to the window I clarified again but was told they didn t have that in their system and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn t have what I ordered I told him to go out and check his menu because it was on there He told me he didn t need to that it was not on the menu He was very rude and dismissive I realize it is just a few cents difference but why should anyone pay for something they didn t order especially if what you ordered is on the menu I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally and rudely I don t recommend visiting this McDonalds luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect 
-1,Drive thru order was botched We paid for two milks and upon arriving home discovered that there were no milks and instead of the healthier grilled chicken that my wife ordered she was unable to eat the crispy chicken that we received due to dietary reasons what a waste Hopefully somebody got the milks we bought Avoid the drive thru at all costs This was not the first time and we should have stopped and checked the order Never again

-1,Incorrect order and couldn t mix Powerade and sprite for some reason 
-1,McDonald s in Roanoke has been a disappointment to me lately It seemed like a good idea to use them as a fast stop for breakfast on my way to work this past week Unfortunately I was let down by the service I received The first day I ordered In the drive through and the lady taking my order seemed like should could not understand me so when I got to the first window and paid I asked for a receipt the lady s response was We don t have receipts When I got to the second window and received my food it was comandwich than what I had ordered I decided to try them again one last time the third morning in a row and the service in the drive through was rather rude just like the first time and I received the wrong size coffee AGAIN When I asked the man about it his response was I don

-1,I have been in line for minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonald s Sylvia said I did I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said it s a two lane and I said no ma am and other people in line roll their windows down and said it s only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were in line waiting You re going to have a catastrophic accident there if you don t get two lanes drawn up Number two Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the same I m very disappointed how McDonald s has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the are trying to prevent an accident I thought the motto is safety first 
-1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement The manager screams at everyone who is a customer To me his young pond has no experience in customer service I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location this is very true I have gone through drive threw and walked in To see bad people working there just do not care I did send message to McDonald s Company hopefully someone will see what 
-1,The drive through service is horrible They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait I waited for over minutes for them The manager Maria Gutierrez might have her last name wrong FIRE HER After waiting for so long I had to drive through again only for her to lie and say she gave me my food Very rude individual Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food

-1,I went to McDonalds this morning for breakfast and got charged for an extra sandwich so I asked for a refund they refunded the cheaper sandwich which was not the wrong one and I pointed it out and they said I was wrong and they refunded the right one I was like okay whatever then they closed to door to fix my drink they apologize for my inconvenience smile and tell me to have a nice day handing over my drink I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway I was nothing but polite Petty does not look good on you McDonalds 
-1,Third time in a row to get the hamburger happy meal with just ketchup only to have cheese added each time My child will not eat it if cheese has touched it They have new toys for the kids however we keep getting toys that are months old Not a good location for the lack of service and food 
-1,I went through the drive thru and ordered cheese burgers I waited in line for like minutes I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasn t ready It wasn t even busy so I didn t understand why it took so long to make cheeseburgers After waiting in my car for more minutes I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted minutes waiting for food As soon as I ask for a refund one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me I guess they forgot I was waiting on it I will never come back to this location 
-1,The Staff is very rude Me and My friend were gonna order sonething over the phone as we were waiting for someone to answer the phone Me and My friend were telling Jokes to each other My friend told me a joke and someone answered the phone we didn t anyone was on the line so he kept telling me The joke so about of No where THE MANAGER tells my friend Stop prank calling here or I m Gonna call the cops and send them to your house I have Your Number My friend tried to Tell the Manager that he didn t know someone was on the line but the Manager decides that he isn we calling this Place back unless the Manger apologizes for being rude 
-1,I usually defend fast food joints even McDonalds Not a very picky person However this visit to this location was very disappointing Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars The employees were emotionless and seemed to be rushing you through even though it still took a long time And then to top it off they got my order wrong 
-1,The Staff is very rude Me and My friend were gonna order sonething over the phone as we were waiting for someone to answer the phone Me and My friend were telling Jokes to each other I told my friend a joke as someone answered the phone we didn t hear anyone was on the line so I kept telling her the joke so out of no where THE MANAGER tells me Stop prank calling here or I m Gonna call your house and call the police I have Your Number I then hung up Of course we got mad so my friend called them and asked for the Manager He answered and She explained that he misunderstood us but instead of listening to her He tells her 
-1,Really frustrated with this location I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there I know exactly how much my order should be I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual McDoubles I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order Or so I thought Instead of paying I was charged for ONE Mcdouble It may not seem like much but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices I wonder how much I ve over paid at this location in the past What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order So in order to determine why I paid after tax for ONE Mcdouble I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers 
-1,If I could give them no stars I would they have been messing up my order for year s Remodel didn t help nothing still sucks I ve complained to a district manager don t help I ve had nice manager but she still got my order wrong I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point or there was a hidden camera Cuz they got my order wrong x s in s row this place is A JOKE 
-1,Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading Fries were soggy and unappealing Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food Stay clear of this place Staff definitely doesn t care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment 
-1,Honestly I hate to do this but the moment I walked in it smelled like a porta potty and I was like let me just order I ordered hot and spicy s NO LETTUCE a large drink and a large fry The Coke was ok the fries like always not full but fresh and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without I told the kid in the front this sandwich has lettuce one it which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said well it only says one sandwich no lettuce I mean come on guys The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him just fix the dang sand which Don t sit there and argue So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it At that point I asked for a refund little did they know I speak Spanish So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh so sorry I am an inconvenience to you but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldn t have been an issue Jesus the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered He gets a star But my experience was just horrible 
-1,I come here every morning for breakfast on my way to work Ever since they got the Angry Bird eyebrows chick workin the drive through my order is always wrong Not a little wrong like very wrong Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam But she trys to give me a Frappuccino Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drive thru window I even have talked to the shift manger and he laughed it off I cant wait for the new Mc Ds to open on and

-1,As a frequent customer of this McDonald s I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor As a franchise you shouldn t be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine
-1,Number of times we ve ordered from this McDonalds Number of times they ve gotten the order right It cannot be spelled out any clearer Quarter pounder Absolutely nothing on it No cheese Just the meat and the bun It is so simple Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous So I get home to see if i can salvage this order Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it The stale burned bun breaks picture I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there s another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well I give up FightFor indeed

-1,Their food taste like plastic Very unsatisfied with them They used to be good But now it s like they don t care if the food is fresh or not 
-1,Absolutely horrible Not sure who the owner is but they should definitely get a new staff and get Mcdonald s corporate to come in for training The service is bad and so is the food They give you what they want not what you pay for especially as it gets closer to closing time Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration Complete disgrace Go a little further in bellevi

-1,Companies need to understand it s not anymore The public is tired of your excuses Be aware this location starts breakfast at am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash and mobile orders are not accepted and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this Maybe it s legit seems shady though If anything it is poor management It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start and the mobile app should not be accepting orders

-1,Couldn t even order I was greeted at the drive thru with we re only taking one order at a time there are people in front of you I ll get to you when I can so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed After minutes at the speaker waiting I pulled off without ever being spoken to again to find at least or staff members kind of just hanging out inside surely not moving the drive thru line along

-1,Be Aware Always a problem in this branch Either order is wrong or missing key ingredients in burgers like ketchup for example or stale meat ingredients or the high prices or the minutes long lines etc What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonald s manager I was told there s nothing they can do about it Very bad area to be in for sure Ghetto employees and ghetto customers Better to drive couple more miles either way on than to come here

-1,The food is no good for you since I have found out since the last time I reviewed this that there is pork in their hamburger I will not be going there anymore I should sue them as what I should do I haven t ate pork in years very disappointing and you would think a big establishment like this could get turkey bacon or turkey sausage

-1,Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and that s what we thought we got Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there She was slightly aggressive we left

-1,The people in this place could not get any more Dumber Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drive thru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time 
-1,They were very rude and food was cold They refuse to let us inside and made us wait mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE Next time I m in town I ll never go to this McDonald s They were slow rude and not friendly

-1,Very bad so gross didn t do clean up 
-1,Terrible customer service ordered from the kiosk was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me To make matters worse the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees While they stood and had conversation I waited min before I received a Did you order Not even the management acknowledged me can t expect good service if the management doesn t know how to give it 
-1,They never seems to get our order right Thank God we always check our food and for some reason I always have to go inside and they get in an attitude So we will not be returning nor recommending to any of our friends or family

-1,Service was trash took them minutes to take my order no exaggerations Seriously can t even salt fries for some reason and the employees weren t able to organize correctly For example at one point there were three employees gathered around to fill one order ONE ORDER Seriously I d recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here 
-1,Worst MCdonalds experience ever minutes and counting and no order Don t ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad
-1,Service was terrible wouldn t allowed to use the app couldn t redeem point wouldn t let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger
-1,I m sorry to give only one star But during our visit were in the children s area of tables or seats are not clean It was uncomfortable for me to sit there There were many spots to see unappetizing if the area for the guests looks like how is it in the kitchen I do not want to imagine it I will not go there a second time 
-1,I placed my order at pm tonight and got the order at about pm I had to call to make sure they received my order Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy not this place 
-1,This was the worst McDonald s I ve been in We ordered using the kiosk and they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food We waited minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husband s drink He went to the counter to get it and they didn t believe him at first My coffee had the label on it for what I d ordered but it didn t have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and the coffee was tepid I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonald s for a while The staff didn t seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonald s website and we left 
-1,I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order The manager Judith stated that if I don t come before am them I d have to wait until the next day to receive my order Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine I understand that my items were not available after that time but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are too busy 
-1,I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonald s to in the past This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly At that time it was worth it The menu was cheap or at least what you know to expect from a international chain and since it s a chain you know what the food is gong to be like So let s look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants You need to set yourself apart with your service This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant Sadly I don t think they care anymore The last time we went half of the kiosks weren t working One of the three that was didn t print receipts This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious Actually there was a lot that played into it Now if you ve gone to McDonald s at all recently you know you pick your food at the kiosk get a number that you take to your table pay at the kiosk sit down and wait for your food Typically all of that takes about five minutes Well this day and what I ve garnered from tourists and locals on many other days the team at work decided they weren t going to bring the food to the table That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn t happen After about minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together only a slight exaggeration we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren t calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters Ok So I go up to the counter and wait We get our food minutes later and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected No big deal we are used to this My in laws are visiting and at this point I m trying to figure why they haven t received their order It dawned on me that my father in law doesn t have a receipt remember the machine that wasn t printing receipts The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt not the tent number Apparently my in laws food was ready in a master of minutes amazing since that is all customized and placed in the abandoned order area If we hadn t said anything they would never have received their food The lady never once called a tent number We told another person of the lack of receipt problem That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt she asked us what the receipt number was We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine and she asked again for the receipt Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump I m not sure if they just didn t staff well on this shift but like I said I ve talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while 
-1,Hands down the worst McDonald s I ve ever experienced Rudest employees Lady in drive thru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help Other people ordered ate and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over minutes waiting for double cheeseburgers and a fry A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer Never got my money back a
-1,Really slow service took over minutes to receive the food after it had been delivered to another table When it did arrive the chicken and burger were cold Duly sent back to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick but no apology 
-1,Take the extra minutes to go to a different location My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke seconds after it was handed to me The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who should ve been in the kitche
-1,Ridiculous i am not one to ridicule this is pure ridiculousness I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can t even get a kids meal right you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples I received double fries no nuggets as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets I tried calling when I arrived back No one answered the phone Here is your negative review that could ve been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues
-1,Slowest McDonald s I have ever been to in my life Took an hour just to order in drive thru Then took another minutes just to get our food orders burgers apple pie and pc nugget so shouldn t have taken to long at all
-1,Busy under staffed slow service condiment stand a mess out of lids ketchup dispenser broken I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table Very very ill run and poorly managed location Just awful 
-1,Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind cars for minutes Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car Rude staff as well Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier I would have even settled for checkers across the street and that s saying a lot because I don t think anyone willingly eats at checkers
-1,I have ordered many times from this mcdonalds how do you screw up a cheeseburger I asked for no ketchup no mustard no pickles no onion I got no condiments and NO MEAT I mean really learn to read and pay attention This is my rd time this has happened 
-1,Extremely rude and impatient I asked for water cups with my meal and I got a glare and only one cup Then my brother who ordered a piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didn t include any that we asked for after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got of the he asked for He came back frustrated with only so I told him to go back for more He asked the manager times to her face very nicely for more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother Not impressed
-1,Double check your orders I got someone else order and when i took it back The employee placed it back to give it to someone else I told her I touched the burger to throw it away She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away Horrible attitude from the cashier Order was not completed

-1,If it were possible to leave stars I would Absolutely zero customer service The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed neither of them spoke a word in person The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldn t be bothered to tell us which of the pick up windows to stop at I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy but they weren t at all Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction

-1,Worst McDonalds I 
-1,This location has slow service and horrible customer service The computer order machine was not working instead of informing custmers they said nothing Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees For such a big business and being involved in so many charities you think they would emphasize excellent customer service McDonalds you are slipping 
-1,This McDonald s was the worst i haver ever been in ZERO STARS Floor in entrance was flooded Bathrooms disgusting Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice Garbage cans over flowing to people inside with one person working the register This after sitting in drive through fir to minutes without moving 
-1,What is the point in having employees in a store if they don t help you The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine The store was empty What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order They are getting paid to chit chat Bad customer service

-1,Spent minutes in the drive thru most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food Didn t get a straw my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my son s happy meal had no toy All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldn t get either one right even after a minute wait Completely unacceptable

-1,Absolutely the worst service They can t figure out the mobile app orders when asked how to fix issues with long wait times the ride staff just says what do you want me to do If you like people being rude to you and very slow service this is your place to not eat 
-1,Seems like the more one goes to this location the worse it gets toasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task it wouldn t be bad but lying about toasting it Shame on them apparently after a certain hour it is not a priority to make decent food for the public or decent fries not to mention a double cheeseburger simply gross Good grief this place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stops to keep going by cause Checkers is right down the road 
-1,I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonald s for four days now Every morning we walk over to McDonald s to get bacon egg and cheese biscuits and hash browns EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we ve went over there we have gotten hard rubbery cold biscuits Their hash browns are hard as well and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with better biscuits However the replacement biscuits were undercooked They were very doughy I do not recommend this place to anyone The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food 
-1,Just went and got McChicken Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger The entire order was old French fries were saggy like and old lady titis The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down First is the shake machine and now the coke Come on man Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck
-1,I guess when you re in a tourist area you don t have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business Stale burger buns cold and burnt french fries Medium fries box was about full Drive thru employee didn t say two words to me beyond the price of my meal 
-1,I went through the drive thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I ve now been sitting here over minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald s to go to seeing as they don t seem to care about their customers
-1,The worst McDonald s I ve been to Went in around maybe at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel Went inside because the drive through line had at least cars no big deal I was ordering a carryout Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the piece chicken nugget meal I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then my boys love McDonald s she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day I asked her name but it couldn t really understand what she said because she was talking fast Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend she didn t know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didn t remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it Manager didn t believe me I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal 
-1,Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating then he just threw it away hopefully he does not get sick Kids meal CB ordered with no onions not rang up that way was covered in onions Lessons here cook outs not being done to make sure on quality not serving raw product cashier needs a little more training because when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions a Large diet cook as the drink He did not put on there the no onions then asked me what did I want to drink 
-1,It s really ridiculous that I m coming every day for my breakfast at this branch and they don t care about customer satisfied every morning I ordered hot coffe and they gave me cold one Again and again it happened

-1,I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life 
-1,Very slow customer service nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice Not up to standards
-1,Seriously this place is gone to the dogs Imagine sitting in line at a fast food restaurant for over minutes to get a burger and fries Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container I m so sick of these restaurants Fast food is no longer fast food the service is subpar and the food is not even as advertised I m literally getting jipped on my food while also waiting for almost minutes to get it 
-1,When I called and asked for a whopper they just hung up on me I WANT MY WHOPPER 
-1,I m not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I can t find anything positive This branch is the slowest I have ever been to It never gets my order right no matter how simple I made it The burger s condiments were all wrong The fry s were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate 
-1,There has never been a single time where I go here at night and it s open Not once Says it 
-1,I never ever go here because it s the most incompetent McDonald s I ve ever seen operate I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was so I know a thing or two about the process and how it s really not rocket science but somehow they can t ever get it right Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn t specify which one to go to although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know Tonight it was missing fries we ordered a total of whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while stone cold fries I wouldn t put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I m sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it I would be embarrassed to own this place Don t go here I know it s fast food and we shouldn t expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints Trust me it s worth the drive 
-1,Very unsatisfied order was wrong Management correct my order Just gave me an extra fry and dismissed me Will not be returning My money is just as good at burger King I understand that you are short handed but that should never compromise customer service 
-1,When I approached the window the gentleman cashier just looked at me I said Hello and he did not speak I handed him my card and he took it as if he were frustrated When he handed the card back to me I said Thank you and he said nothing back I m not one to usually make a big deal about things I try not to be that person however the way he acted was so unnecessary Maybe I reminded him of someone I do not know and never will know I just refuse to go to this location again 
-1,Went there tonight around and the drive thru worker didn t have his headphone mic off and just kept cursing saying this is bull and kept on I go to order my food and he tells me the milkshake machine is down No problem but when I politely ask if there s a certain time it 
-1,yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back I m happy I don t work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong and you pay for not what you get its sad we can t afford to pay for sonthing we want and get ripped off let s do better guys if you don t like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job 
-1,Today visit was the worse Other stops they forgot things or wrong in my orders forgetting hashbrowns wrong items drinks made wrong But today it took the cake The work took a couple of minutes to take are order Then when we got are order my wife check it all the items where there But only ideam that where right was the hash browns and a sweet tea Order a Bacon egg and cheese biscuit or hash Browns and sweet tea nd order was a sausage egg mcmuffin with a hot chocolate We got a sausage muffin with cheese and a sausage muffin with a hot chocolate that my wife said it was not drinkable If you ask why didnt we take it back We dont have time drop the wife off at work then i get on the road to go to work Dont think we be going back to this McDonald s its becoming more of a disappointment then a enjoyment

-1,Worst McDonald s in the area After waiting in line over minutes I finally get to the window for them to inform me that they were closed Mind you this was at am Saturday morning The store hours for this location reads closes at a m not a m Clearly management didn t want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing Will never go back to this location 
-1,I live close so I frequent this location They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can t even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer They just take the card hand it back most of the times without the receipt and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word Head a few miles down A A and get much better service with a friendlier staff 
-1,The last in a string of bad experiences I only received half my order and it was still wrong Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible Won t be returning
-1,This has been one of the worst McDonald s I have been too Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough The food now left a lot to be desired French fries were not fresh They had zero salt We ordered a piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces Then on top of that they re old and stale and cold Needless to say we will never be going there again 
-1,Miyra is extremely rude and slow Acts like she hates her job Took minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown
-1,Horrible McDonald s I had visited this McDonald s in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign or just tell me politely to watch my step I would ve kept coming to this McDonald s but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired 
-1,Today at approximately I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me give it to me now in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries now if you could give me a feedback because it really is not the way to serve the customer
-1,i m honestly only leaving one star because i have to staff was rude as can be i went through the drive thru and ordered a the cheeseburger meal and an extra cheeseburger with a small fry and at the window checked the food and the employee was rude asked if we got a problem and rolled her eyes well the order was wrong so good thing i checked went inside the store and finally got my cheeseburgers after standing there for minutes and complained to the manager and she walked away with no response Finally got my food and opened it up and there was A HAIR IN MY FOOD the entire order was wrong the first time around Never will i ever go back to this restaurant again terrible service i just ended up going bac

-1,Two employees preparing the food simply didn t wear a mask I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask Why during this pandemic which has not settled in the least have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers It s unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out With a mask on To save lives Consider this message before you enter this McDonald s Or any restaurant really because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time And the fries were luke warm

-1,The person who took our order charged us for a large meal and then rang in a small drink When I questioned the girl giving us our items she got defensive and accused the drink machine She argued with us the entire time she was fixing the problems Never again 
-1,Worst McDonalds The girl at the window had no idea what she was doing She got an attitude and got her manager because she couldn t handle why we were asking for the new garlic white cheddar burger Every worker here makes it obvious they don t want to work 
-1,Says minute delivery yet for the past year it

-1,Disappointing McDonald s is my standby for fast food Normally I get consistent food with decent sometimes amazing service I know it s not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food Shrink flation at its best Half filled fries Soda with no refills Seriously Especially now that a combo meal costs At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review
-1,We were inside a Walmart McDonald s My granddaughter has food allergies to egg dairy So there are only a few things that she can have We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices Next we ordered apple juice They were all out of apple juice as well The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here Was not happy with the service here The food and service times are not the same as it used to be 
-1,Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers Watching customers that ordered over mins after myself get theirs first After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked This place shouldn t even be open
-1,I visited this location at pm The young ladies black and Hispanic that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go First and last time visiting this location Smh customer service training needed asap
-1,The manager was rude I waited for more than minutes understanding that they were busy but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed The worst customer service additionally tells me that my refund will be from to days since after minutes waiting It only said that there were many orders 
-1,No cashiers order takers you must use their self service kiosk which they have several of You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table however this wasn t the case for us The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby We were seated less than feet away from her and in her line of sight We raised our hand and said that s us She saw us but made no attempt to deliver the food I don t mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table but I m feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this point we placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a full service McDonald s charges Several people in store and in drive thru returned food due to being cold old or not made correctly This included us at in the afternoon the nuggets were cold chewy and seemed old I would think this wouldn t be the case given p m is during the lunch rush Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready Double cheeseburger was made correctly no mustard or pickles but bun was not warm dry and cheese was cold not melted managers were in the kitchen button up shirts with ties along with employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shuffle paced leisurely stroll walk I worked at McDonald s and Burger King as a teenager and was always told If you got time to lean you ve got time to clean and that was during slow dead times not lunch rush I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be minutes for fresh ones was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one 
-1,Visited drive through closed at pm
-1,horrific service this is NOT the world s largest McDonald s as people are reviewing on here this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC ordering at the drive thru took almost minutes this did not include waiting for the food the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him did not correctly take our order would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time i have never in my life been to a McDonald s with worse service avoid at all costs
-1,Rude and unattentive staff They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way I turned around and walked out the door 
-1,Rude staff Slow food delivery Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up Food quality is poor 
-1,Waited to long at drive thru while other line was moving App code for deal canceled out and I had to wait for the code to appear again Crew not helpful at drive thru or inside

-1,How do you go to a McDonald s that says hours there 
-1,If I could give starts I would been here several times and the service is trash They never have anything Didn t have ranch sauce or McFlurry or any other hamburgers They only had nuggets and this is what I get with a white stuff in it Don 
-1,Went through the drive thru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me So I had to go back in and tell them about my order And when I went back to let them know they gave me look like I was bothering I ve never apologized poor management 
-1,Arrived at the McDonald s at PM and the posted hours said the location was open until AM An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didn t let us in until we mobile ordered although another employee seemed confused by this Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed again even though the hours stated that the location would be open until AM Additionally while this happened there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating and there were empty tables 
-1,Hours are inaccurate they close the dining room before not midnight as is posted on their doors The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee which makes it taste like burnt tea gross 
-1,Didn t know you could barricade customers out with trash cans one and a half hours before closi
-1,Please hire employees that actually want to work and like their job and smile this girl that just took my order with extremely long red Nails was very unpleasant Do you follow a dress code in this establishment Also this must be the saddest sundae i have ever received half the Carmel was outside the cup Maybe that 
-1,My kids are big on McDonald s and I thought it would be fun for them Big mistake Place is a dump and a joke The food was cold and the facility is filthy The drink area had no ice in dispensers No ketchup The play area was frightenin

-1,Horrible I ordered the same meal I always order when I go to McD s Fish fillet Fries There was nothing fillet about my fish it was dry stale and so was the fries So disappointed 
-1,I am a client I am a tourist and how is it possible that it is closed and people have to be ordering by walking where the cars go they expose their clients an accident can happen how do I do if I don t have a car like those people did How dangerous and disrespectful for customers I ve been coming for days and it s the same it s at night and it s closed but it says it s hours
-1,They close whenever they feel like it Employees are there they just ain t give you food 
-1,I ordered a strawberry smoothie they gave me a mango smoothie instead I told them I ordered a strawberry smoothie their crew is very upset Than she brought me a strawberry smoothie and told me this is the size for smoothie

-1,Food was terrible and so much missing Service even worse Like eating at Karen s restaurant in UK AVOID AT ALL COSTS 
-1,Went to this location around am and placed an order through the app Waited in the drive thru for minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open hours a day signs on their windows Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonald s 
-1,No chocolate shakes available This location should have good stocks of everything 
-1,The worst experience minutes for our food after complaining People ahead of us are still there waiting DO NOT GO
-1,These people have drive truths but only takes orders from one stood here min got skip times and then was told to have patience
-1,The worst I know it s fast food but corp needs to straighten this place out bad service bad attitudes for being so tourist friendly area this was the least friendly
-1,This place really should be shut down If they can t deliver in customer service just close I ordered with them and waited for minutes I asked them after minutes about my order and they said it s coming up After minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me one at a time I can t skip your order in front of other people She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people At minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it Nobody gave an apology or acknowledged they were in the wrong If you can t run a restaurant correctly then please just shut down There are countless pictures on their reviews of cars piling up and terrible customer service 
-1,To hell with this McDonald s They closed their lobby 
-1,Worst McDonalds ever No personal service or friendly service Stay away and have a good day somewhere else 
-1,These employees don t know how to prepare Mobile Orders You build your order on the phone and pay for everything you added then the employees give you the wrong thing I ordered an iced latte with caramel drizzle and whipped cream I received a regular iced coffee with nothing that I paid extra for This had happened or times now 
-1,Rude amateur counter staff asked cleaner a question just pointed me to the front counter without saying a word more expensive tourist area Overall nice building thats about it food arrived to table cold Just like being in a Circus full of clowns

-1,Did an order on the mobile app Ordered two sweet teas when got to drive thru they told me they had no sweet tea Had to cancel and place new order for cokes Drive thru took minutes Slowest I have ever seen 
-1,This review is about the staff at this location I visited this McDonalds around pm to pick it up my food My wife did another mobile order and I just arrived and tried to explain to the manager I think she was I have another order that was not on the screen She was rude and answer one order at the time of course the first order arrived and I was still standing waiting for the other one more than min Another friendly Girl Danisha I thinks was her name tried to help me out and the manager stopped her and sent to carry other stuff in the back She was in charge for drive thru and one Spanish customer was making an order Danisha asked her to help and she said I can t I was shocked about this
-1,Food is terrible but the workers are very polite 
-1,Hawaiian Court location Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the Fast Food label From order to recieving the food it took mins and even then the order came out wrong There was one manager one fry cook and one burger cook trying to complete a dinner time rush yet there were cleaning staff going round cleaning table every mins or so This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time because this really was a poor attempt at fast food 
-1,Brittany The Manager was completely rude and wanted to call the cops just because I ordered a cup of coffee and their whole system was down 
-1,RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump We ordered doubles chicken large fries and large drinks Everything every thing tasted hard like cardboard The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones Both the chicken and doubles had no no no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke both were large size which they did not get right the first time Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor The food was over dry and tasteless The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterday s old food if not last weeks old junk It s almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did 
-1,Horrible Service Lazy Workers Took Forever to make my order ans there liars
-1,Terrible service Cashier had a bad attitude and was very disrespectful Refused to give her name Found out it is Brittany Female manager seemed clueless amd not helpful whatsoever After over an hour from the time we entered the drive thru til we got our food it was still made wrong We ve submitted the issue to corporate requesting contact No response Obviously they do not care about their customers 
-1,Terrible customer service the lady at the drive thru was handing me someone else order after me telling her my order is an online order she then got mad and left the window then the second young lady told me to go to the third window without telling me that they just received my order and is in the process of making it I called the store and the manager was nasty after I was just telling him that Communication would have been nice and yelling at me telling me I don t need to tell him that and I asked for corporate number and the lady said they don t have it and I asked for her name and she walked away quickly from me rude everyone here is rude and disrespectful and no communication with there customers I would recommend going to a different location that s mo
-1,I don t understand why all the time that I come to eat in here is always a problem All the employees doing nothing the restaurante is always slow at night its empty and they take ho
-1,Only giving one star because zero stars isn t an option Wanted to pay cash at register and was told to use kiosk Kiosk never gave an option for cash pay Employees wandering the store on their phones and ignoring customers When asked for napkins an employee went thru two other employees instead of just handing customer napkins No organization at all and rude as can be Gave me diet soda when I asked for regular they rolled their eyes I understand it s busy but this place could be handled better Go anywhere but here 
-1,Twice they ve forgotten loads of my order on uber eats No refunds Nothing Absolutely a joke
-1,When you go on slow Thursday night order yourself a nice Double Quater pounder with cheese to go after a long days work Only to see you get a single quater pounder No cheese and i guess they decided to throw in some lettuce on there No sauce like pickles Too tired to go get a refund c
-1,Although conveniently located to several hotels the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located Even when we were at the window it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together Once back the hotel we discovered that one of our orders was wrong They placed bacon on one of the fish sandwiches 
-1,My friends and family were denied service at this location because we prefer to place our order with a human rather than a kiosk st by an employee then by the manager VERY RUDE am 
-1, McDonald s corporate you need to investigate this location immediately The customer service is highly lacking and I m positive the management of that location is damaging your brand Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited Zero response We spoke multiple times No reaponse No one greeted us No one asked us to wait Nothing Radio silence Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder Needless to say we drove away without making an order It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald s 
-1,We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the kiosks are open We wait in line for min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine but now I never plan to visit again 
-1,Waited in drive thru for mins finally got up to order nothing We kept asking if anyone is there Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system could be another mins at least We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building Truly horrible service 
-1,Terrible I never write reviews but couldn t complete my day consciously without expressing my frustration It s one thing to be busy and dealing with the public I know it s challenging To be rude for absolutely no reason when simply asking a question such as 
-1,I ordered breakfast at January order order We could have ate breakfast at the resort we are staying at but my family elected for McDonald s instead Not only did I have to wait an extended period three to five minutes at the order board but we had a large order When I got up to window number one the girl working the window was rude did not want to allow me to review my large order with her spoke extremely fast and unprofessional then rushed me to the next window without even paying Once I drove to the next window I was handed my food still hadn t paid tried reviewing the order again and the woman didn t listen or pay me any attention I sat patiently and she rushed back to the window to collect payment AFTER everything was given to me Our re under cooked mushy but the rest of or breakfast was good I would relay to your staff that the overall experience drives a customer back not just the food Wendy s filled the remainder of our order efficie
-1,We walked over from the hotel that was in the same lot The door sign said the dining room was open to am We got in the dinning room at about when other costumers who were already inside walked out We were asked to leave as the dining room was 
-1,It s not actually a hour store They re open but if you go at night around a m and a m it s going to be closed I think they switch for a dinner to breakfast but it s unfair for people who work third shift like myself I can almost never get McDonald s It s funny cuz they also barricade all the doors and drive throughs 
-1,Stop to get b fast they must have been in a rush cause when I went to eat my sandwich the sandwich looked like it was dropped several times 
-1,Closed restaurant even though it 
-1,Worst most disrespectful group on of individuals I have ever met in my entire adult life This includes the manager who was working at am Sunday who decided she couldn t be bothered t
-1,I walked in the door with my son in law to order inside because it said dining room open till am It was am We went to every kiosk none working We walked up to register A woman back towards the back yelled out that they were closed Well we walked out got in our van pulled up to drive through Nobody responded We turned off engine a waited a bit Nobody We left and visited Wendy s drive thru 
-1, min wait for food and order wasn t even correct Other people told me they d waited an hour Also some of the most unhappy theme park bound families you re ever going to see in this place Overall a disaster consider starving instead 
-1,Literally waited minutes The sign says to place tent on table and relax Your delicious food is on its way but it wasn t even delivered to us 
-1,rude customers half the kiosk malfunction and staff is not trained to help if it malfunctions Managers are so busy solving issues with equipment they cant manage the staff High turnover homeless people camping out inside Overall way to crowded and overpriced travel the extra mile and go to the next McDonald 
-1,With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast If you don t get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dry hard biscuit I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone There goes almost ten bucks 
-1,Zero starts All tables were unattended They were all dirty Food took a while Manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food I stood for a few minutes ready to place my order I was the next client No one I mean Not a soul greeted me acknowledge my presence or anything Not even an exchange of words when I got my food which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me Not a you re welcome when I said thanks Nothing I would not come here again 
-1,Absolutely horrible place After waiting minutes we had to ask how much longer The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me The manager finally came and couldn t even find my order The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando 
-1,Dinning room was closed at PM Hours on the door say AM to AM There were many employees inside but they only served drive thru and refused to open dinning room 
-1,What an awful place Unless I am desperate I will never return here 
-1,I placed an order through the improved kiosk system and over minutes later had to inquire about it Turns out the order had been completed but staff were busy with other dutys so it just sat there So much for customer service However the shift leader did apologize Honestly I d rather have hot food And once in my vehicle I discovered the order was not even correct Failure level complete My first time in a McDonald s in almost years Now I remember why Given the choice I have no need to return to McDonald s ever 
-1,Well i have never ever been eye rolled on a drive through before but i guess there s always a first time for everything we order shakes the lady gave us spoons and we asked for straws she got offended by this and eye rolled us Training Training Training please to these people on dealing with customers 
-1,Worst service ever waited at the counter mins manager said be would be right there currently still waiting while review like dam can I get my Mcflurry Manager seen in photo 
-1,All our burgers were not cooked 
-1, mins on a Thursday night Nothing makes sense anymore with everything being terrible and no sense of urgency in any aspect of this place Fire the whole crew from the manager on down and start over 
-1,I really don t want to be that guy and I typically do not leave bad reviews But this experience this morning was absolutely HORRIBLE I waited min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to cook Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine My issue came with the TWO managers that were taking care of the guests Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it These managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesn t work weekends Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness 
-1,worst service i 
-1,Massively understaffed min wait for food Also got the order wrong Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire inflation is rampant and end times are near Also every fat miserable Disney going family you d never want to run into frequents this place Avoid at all costs
-1,Honestly has to be the most useless people in this place ordered twice via Uber eats and both orders was wrong so tonight s orders here goes missing fries and a Big Mac come on how stupid can these people be if I was the boss I would send them all home I will be emailing McDonald 
-1,They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times It is not busy I just left and went to get food from someone else Why is that the only way to order I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers 
-1,Extremely unreliable Not enough staff to run the store Sometimes no drive thru sometimes OBLY drive thru This is stupid considering there s more people
-1,For me to give them a start is too much I went several time there and the foot is awful the chicken nugget the cold and old and I asked the lady the next time I went around if she can please make sure that the nuggets are fresh She reply fresh you want them fresh And I replied please Do I pay at the window pick up my order the one I drove away I grabbed one of the nuggets and that look and feel like they were sitting since the next day I have to throw my food away never again 
-1,Ordered using their self serve machines Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine Waited minutes No food Politely asked the manager behind the counter and they had missed our order and thought it had been prepared No apology just a rude manager telling us to sit down and it will be be brought to us
-1,Easily the worst fast food experience My girlfriend and I were feeling sick from needing to eat something and stopped here Location is hr but the doors were locked to stop ppl coming in A customer let us in and we were greeted to customers demanding refunds ridiculous wait times and them being out of many items Staff is very rude and condescending and the place is very poorly managed 
-1,Dirty store waited minutes for our food and never received it We left I would like my back No origination worst McDonald s I ve ever been to 
-1,Do not eat here save yourself time and money I ordered here times in a month and every time it was wrong you would think I would learn I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain Thinking the less work the better Nope some how plain means ketchup only Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McD s number to complain I am local so I have choices to eat at other places You know what Wendy s is sounding a lot better these days It s not even a short staff problem its a I don t care problem I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others losing my order each trip wont hurt then in the short term But over a long time it will and will make sure I let others know to for go McD and go somewhere else STAY AWAY 
-1, It s am and there 
-1,Never get what you order 
-1,No bacon and the food is cold fries old
-1,So rude i asked a question i couldnt find the answer to online and the girl asked me if i knew what google was before hanging up on me Kept hanging up on me and everytime i called back there was a new girl claiming to be the manager and they are all disgustingly rude Im actually shocked by how they treat other humans like this I came in earlier at and the guys working there were very nice but calling at pm i was not treated even decently by all the girls in there The people here act like you ve killed there family members or something Learn to act like a normal human being or go back to your moms basement and get out of customer service you disgusting humans My cousin also left a 
-1,Waited ages for food cold when arrived at table and items missing Stood in a queue full of people complaining to get food sorted by which time the rest of our order was stone cold Staff not very pleasant and looked like they didnt care at all Not a good experience and wont be back

-1,Asked for an iced caramel latte and they gave me an iced coffee Went back and payed AGAIN for an iced caramel latte and they gave me a cup with pure white milk only and no caramel at all Is it that hard to make a latte 
-1,I came in at the drive through line was so long and I saw families eating food inside I decided to go in as it said the lobby hours are until I knocked on every door wondering if anyone was going to open up the door but no The worker shook her head at me sternly and wouldn t even give me the explanation as to why she wouldn t open the door Mind you I also was in my military uniform and she went out of her way to disrespect me all she would have had 
-1,Total dump Long unreasonable waits The dining room was filthy Missing sauce for nuggets No lids for the cups No napkins It s like dining in the third world 
-1,I can t even give them a star We had to order times after sitting in line for over mins they still got it wrong Their team needs training severely We ended up working with the manager and he did give us the food free spouse and teenage found it inedible 
-1,This place is awful The lines are looooong inside or drive through being waiting for minutes for happy meals I think is one of the slowest in the state Needs lots of work hopefully management gets involved and fix the deficiencies
-1,Both online and the sign here says they are hr Tried coming in to get some food for my kids last night after a hrs road trip They had shut down the drive through and doors When I CALLED THE STORE AND ASKED THE MANAGER HUNG UP IN MY FACE TIMES WHEN ALL I WAS ASKING WAS WHAT TIME DO THEY CLOSE AND WHY DOES IT SAY HOURS IF YOUR SHUT DOWN THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO THESE ARE THR MANAGERS ACTING LIKE THAT IM FAR BEYOND DISSAPOINTED AND I WILL BE STILL REACHING OUT TO COORPRATE THEY DONT DESERVE THEIR JOBS AT ALL SOMONE ELSE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT JOB AND TREAT THE CUSTOMERS PROPER 
-1,If I could give stars I would We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated we are short staffed and really busy we can t take any more orders for minutes and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders thats understandable but telling people you re not taking orders for the next minutes I mean come on I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business Seems like a poor business practice to me This happened on at by the way 
-1,McDonald s is already a horrible franchise with horrendous service but this location is SO bad that I wanted to write this review to advise NOBODY to come to this location The service is a joke The food always comes out wrong The staff is not fr
-1,This place is terrible They have no inside seating which I guess happens But the manager on duty this morning when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear shameful we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order Wish I knew both names so that I call them out both good for the young lady and BAD for the manager lady on duty 
-1,Incredibly slow service sat in the drive thru for at least minutes without the line moving When I finally got my food the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all on top of that I wasn t asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces the sandwich didn t have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it just oddly dry pickles and a soggy bun I had to park and go inside to get condiments As has become almost expected with the McDonald s experience the soda tasted like sanitizer Never again at this location I only stop at McDonald s if I am blindingly hungry on the verge of passing out and still my past experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting Update Got food poisoning and this is the last thing I ate 
-1,McDonald s just needs to SHUTDOWN Every McDonald s in the Orlando area none EVER open on time systems are ALWAYS down CASH ONLY in the early morning hours IF you can find one that is ACTUALLY OPEN Sign on door states open at am and at am still closed 
-1,Unbelievably SLOW I ordered cheese burgers and frappe They took almost minutes to get our food When they finally came to give us food the employee gave us the wrong food and had the BIGGEST attitude when I said the order was wrong DONT COME HERE IF YOU WANT FAST FOOD ITS MORE LIKE SLOW FOOD Don t recommend horrible will not return again Another thing is put cheese burgers were cold and dry The frappes weren 
-1,Awful AM visit Only two workers Took minutes with nobody in line as the cashier had to run food out to cars waiting too long in drive through Fries were undercooked 
-1,Literally the worst McDonald s I ve ever been to
-1,We waited for minutes in the drive through The line moved at the beginning but then stopped completely near the order box Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldn t escape We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait It was very frustrating The order we received was correct but we didn t get any apology or explanation We ll Mark this location on the map and never go here again 
-1,Thank you for the cold breakfast Made me wait almost minutes Families got theirs before my lil sandwich and coffee They just forgot about my meal and let it sit Only thing warm was the coffee barely Not anyone 
-1,More than minutes waiting for some cheeseburger and fries and when I approach one of the senior employees she reply with an attitude Definitely never stopping on this again 
-1,Rainy first night in Orlando we went here after a super long day at Disney World We waited over min for our food in the drive thru None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru I mean McDonald s is what it is but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit 
-1,I waited minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly If your reading this just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself 
-1,They made me wait in the drive thru parking lot line and still forgot my order that says add cheese This has happened twice yet they still give me the bag with the add cheese stamp on it with false advertising that it is has cheese I am paying for extra cheese and not getting it on my food it s ridiculous and stealing honestly This is the third time this has happened Will be calling c
-1,Rudest staff ever I literally just wanted water I asked how to get water and this lady just muttered something and pointed somewhere So I asked another employee and was straight up ignored Tear this place down it ain t working 
-1,Very rude employee taking orders slammed the window in my face and left and didn t charge me also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite horrible experience staffsocks 
-1,Took over half an hour to received food and it was stone cold staff looked demoralise when asked a member of staff about my food she just looked at me and walked away would never go there again spent over dollars for poor service and food 
-1,I am here in Orlando on vacation and I ordered via Uber eats and when I got my order the happy meal had no fries My large fries were half empty cold and soggy My deluxe chicken sandwich was cold as well I ordered a large sprite with it and it was flat and didn t taste right Tha
-1,Sometimes high tech doesn t mean faster Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drive thru Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food They had just mopped with customers inside so that was a safety hazard Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor 
-1,Service at this place is a joke Sat in the drive threw for minutes waiting of my food The tea is bad percent of the time I believe this falls directly on management As there are always new employees there Most times having poor attitudes Also I have never once been suggested a pie I don t even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer And probably be un edible I only stop in there maybe once a month when I m in a bind 
-1,I ll start with the positive The food I received was the correct order and it was hot The bad What was supposed to be a minute trip ended up being almost because they were severely understaffed and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone Maybe they re better during the day but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you re looking to get in and out 
-1,Open hours but not before am 
-1,Terrible service waited forever for our food Won t be back 
-1,OMG The WORST McDonald s I have EVER been in Orders were on the board and they were just standing around like the had nothing to do Drive thru was closed so everyone had to come inside to place their order This was my first and last time I will NEVER eat at this location No sense of urgency from the manager on duty as well 
-1,McDonald 
-1,Waited almost minutes to get my food while people with bigger orders that came after me got their food When asked what was taking so long they said they are working on the order then followed by asking me what my order was After wards had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave The worst experience ever 
-1,Visited times over a week during a conference This place is a shambles The self ordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic Twice out of those times it s taken more than minutes to get a simple order and it s not even been busy The staff especially the manager Martha is aggressive and disengaged Overall a truly terrible fast food location 
-1,Beagle was old and hash browns cold
-1,Prices are way too high got pulled forward only to wait an extra minutes Still no food Went inside to ask for a refund Food still wasn t ready Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said oh our bun toaster is broken Didn t say that at the window This is an I DRIVE location Absolutely ridiculous Stay away What a waste 
-1,Took over a hour for my order and they need a PC system to let people know their orders are ready THEY NEED MORE HELP
-1,Just had the worst experience at this location Sidel who apparently is one of the managers and is Hispanic like me was extremely rude when we ordered our food through the drive thru She even was making faces at us 
-1,One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to There is no welcomes or thank you Service treats you like you are a problem for them ie the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off the customer said what about my drink The server rolled her eyes walked away brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away No I am sorry no have a nice day For me it took over minutes to just get a milkshake Never Again for me 
-1,Worst customer service Don t even bother to go We waited min for someone to take our order thru the drive tru Horrible and then the l
-1,To whom it may concern Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles I can tell by the damage to the curb that I m not the first to experience this and damaged was caused As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers The right think to do would be to correct it 
-1,I could not recommend this place We pulled up to the drive thru at pm and the guy behind the speaker said just go ahead with your order with the most unpleasant tone When I asked if I could have just a sec he replied again in an unpleasant tone well we close in mins So clearly they didn t want our business and something tells meet they won t want yours Save your time and go elsewhere 
-1,Manager is horrible system was down had an employee at the register adding the amount wrong and when we asked to speak to the manager she called the police because she would not serve us after we got upset that her only response was system was down and what the employee said was correct not even verifying his calculations were valid McDonalds was old school at this point writing orders on a notepad I understand their is miscommunication but ho
-1,Sign on door says drive thru open hrs and there is signage under the McDonald s M by the street that says open hrs They are NOT hrs they open at The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details Need to fix their information 
-1,Absolutely the slowest service I ve ever had at a fast food restaurant Me and my friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals After minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food There was one person working fries one cook on manager assisting the cook and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the After seeing that customers who ordered minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que So he had no idea what any of us ordered We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us minutes later All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty All the employees including the manager didn t even look years old They were definitely under trained mis managed and probably under staffed 
-1,I don t expect star service when I visit a McDonald s but I also don t want an employee full of attitude handling
-1,They re telling everyone in the drive they to come inside but they are making all people waiting in line wait til they take and make a couple orders Been waiting at least minutes they ve helped a total of people Kiosks are all t
-1,Wow just wow Incredibly under staffed wich may have led to EXTREME rudeness Out of or simply didnt want to put out the effect of giving straws cup holder and ketchup And when asked for these items straight out nasty about it This mcdonald s is in parking lot of my hotel so really convenient but will NOT be revisiting If only stars was a option 
-1,Was awful waited mins for food in a half empty place not what I d call fast food then the big mac was luke warm 
-1,We did drive through It took minutes to get cars out The food was cold and the drinks were half empty 
-1,This place was a mess They took FOREVER to serve the few people they had A guy dropped a spatula I was freaking out They would take counter order cause the manager said When we are done in the back So upset with this service 
-1,The cashier servers look miserable and when you smile they just straight up look at you like youre vermin to them They lack personality and they rudely say stuff Even forgot items out of my order Went up and got the wrong reciept printed and recieved attitude from the cashier who printed out my reciept 
-1,Place was rude Ate there twice and this morning lady for mad and purposely messed up the coffees won t go back
-1,Over priced why because they re the biggest shame on this company poor service and worst the food was disgusting got orders wrong HOW was ordered via screen
-1,I guess they got to rip off their guests to afford the building the management staff are rude when you order a shake medium it comes in a little small kids cup I order two Filet O Fish fish or they re not offering the for but that s okay they re not even putting tartar sauce on the sandwich I was just bread the Fish so I guess they had to cut cost somewhere when they charge you for fish and don t put anything on it I won t go back Here is how to save some money fire some of those managers that are rude for your guests and that ll save you some money and start building the sandwich correctly
-1,Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids No line ordered at kiosk right away workers and no one working Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working minutes to get egg McMuffins at am Worst service ever
-1,Another experience I was asked to wait at drive thru No other customers were in queue They forgot about me The order was reduced without telling me The apple pies were removed without any explanation When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn t identify herself She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn t provide it Bad experience with the food too The fries were so over salted I couldn t eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen End to end bad experience Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff I waited at the drive thru order kiosk then at the payment window and then at the pick up window Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait Her response was I just put on the headset Seriously that was her response There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service Why didn t she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness NOT LOVING IT Visited again on and had the same experience Even the white shirt manager ignored me 
-1, hours if you drive maybe advertises as lobby open am am however is closed to the public more often than its open with no explanation of why the doors are locked but drive through is open and employees will just watch you through the window terrible service
-1,Please calibrate The Soda s Machine correctly He has been mixing and preparing sodas wrong for days
-1,This location is incredible It has two stories Has automated machines to order from You can get a variety of different items to try out that aren t at regular McDonald s It s always super busy here too so expect a wait I m a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza I was so sick for the next three days that I couldn t leave bed Never again 
-1,Paid for nuggets by time I walked all the way to my apartment approximately minutes and we started to eat we opened up the food no nuggets
-1,The worst McDonald s in the area I have lived close to this McDonald s for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable Also the team members and management just don t seem to care I m not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant however this last visit has really ticked me off I couldn t even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent and then she wanted to act like she couldn t hear me Other times I have visited this location I have had an issue where items were left off my order so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items it would all be cold I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly items With that said I will not be back to this McDonald s location ever 
-1,Severely understaffed for such a busy location I ve seen McDonald s with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something 
-1,Took more than minutes in drive thru with cars ahead of me Not only the slowest McDonalds ever but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to 
-1,Ordered cheeseburgers with no pickles I got burgers with no cheese and pickles The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if you d like So if you like Russian Roulette this might be the McDonalds for you 
-1,McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service Not sure what s hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative Chick fil A this is why I love you so much 
-1,If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room 
-1,Worlds worst McDonald s Went there on may th at approximately pm pizza was closed play are arcade closed ordered food to eat in tables dirty asked several times to get it cleaned and to get better in had to stand on a line for minutes to get my drink because they wouldn t bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care
-1,This is the worst run McDonald s I have EVER seen in my life the service is super slow Its complete chaos The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff I would rate it zero but that wasn t an option 
-1,If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight The employee manager handling the front end was the rudest individual I ve ever met of all my visits to McDonald s in my years Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food One lady said she d been waiting on her food for over an hour They wouldn t even accommodate her with a refund Infact my order took min to fill The store shut down the kiosks as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby I understand it s easy to get overwhelmed but when you re filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour your prioritizing methods are failing And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers I m on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again But if I were a local they would have just received their last from my pocket My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald s in down town orlando the management lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty McDonald s I d fix this ladies attitude or I d find her replacement 
-1,I have no idea how the employees got hired They are so rude and have no manners They literally see you standing there for over minutes waiting and no one offers to help They all need to stay home if they don 
-1,Drive thru minutes to get to screen to order Then no one to take order for another minutes Can t get out of line Trapped Such slow service Sort of silly for this newly updated McDonald s to be poorly run or staffed 
-1, min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn t have someone who can take my order Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake International Driveway to busy for this time of the day They need more personal 
-1,I wish there were warning signs on the drive in Turn back now unless you have minutes to wait in the drive thru to order pay and receive your food Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you you are stuck Hopefully you don t want any Coke with your meal And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional minutes on to your wait Haven t even tasted my food yet Do not recommend 
-1,Service and costumer service awful horrible 
-1,Took forever which I ve gotten used too being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive But the service and order quality has been way less that satisfactory more times than I could count And not to forget neither of my kids of my kids even got the Pokemon toy or any toy for that matter that they asked for 
-1,Absolute worse McDonalds I ve ever been to Restrooms were a mess ordered food gave up after minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order 
-1,Was awful at this location FILTHY Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table The self pay was out of order took minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay with only other customers in the restraunt Even while patio obviously designed patio was horrendous Trash everywhere spilled drinks on every table Very sad since this location I m sure sees a lot of visitors 
-1,Terrible service Poorly run out of kiosks were down for ordering This was the only option to order at pm at night on a Sat Place was very busy no cashiers on the line Took a number for food to be delivered Called receipt to pick up order at counter Order wrong Forgot Cookie and drink cup Had to go back up to ask for it Counter person did not apologize I will never come back here 
-1,Service was incredibly slow they were out of coke dr Pepper didn t work and they have light lemonade instead of normal All while we were in a hurry to get to the park Very unpleasant experience 
-1,Giant line in the drive through had to wait for about minutes per car and after about minutes we decided to not order there 
-1,I could have gave stars if it stayed original I liked the safari jungle vibe I went with my girlfriend on July th at night time It wasn t crowded and surprised that they renovated and got rid of golden women bathroom 
-1,Forgot to put the sign we are closed 
-1,Arrived starving from water park minutes after ordering large order of food no deals on that was on other branches still no food so asked staff who said would look into it minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of meals and desserts saying rest coming hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize Will never be back If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service 
-1,I couldn t tell you much about the food or service because it wasn t open Supposedly hour location but closed for maintenance The sign had been updated closed from pm to am and then changed again to am I gave up hope at am when it didn t look like it was going to happen Oh well good luck 
-1,Went new year s Eve and was a disaster employees in the heart of tourist district We ordered at Kiosk and waited mins and saw that others that had been There for mins hadn t even paid for much less gotten their food Would have just done as much good to have shut the doors and locked as opposed to being open 
-1,This Mc Donald s it s always really slow Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever I m already waiting minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing It already happened sometimes I will not come back to this Mc Donald s anymore Terrible customer service 
-1,Sat in the drive thru for minutes before being able to order Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line Two other cars followed suit so we couldn t even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call
-1,Unbelievably poor service Ordered items bagged immediately but then waited mins for final item a double cheeseburger By this time first items cold so asked for a fresh re order mins later Walked out with barely an apology Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel Avoid if you can don t expect if you cannot 
-1,Normally visit this location out of days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early am On the frappe machine is down for cleaning at am and now on the system is completely down It s becoming a place that isn t dependable 
-1,What a horrible experience I sat at the front counter for over mins for utensils and sauce on Dec st at pm The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad 
-1,Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens He asked his manager to check She straight out refused We couldn t even complete one of our orders minutes after placing our other order we received fries so cold when I went up to the front to get fresh ones I didn t even have to say anything One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence The bathrooms were nasty the tables were dirty every trash can was over flowing and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando 
-1,What a waste of time we were there in line for more than minutes The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct We spent minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut The manager said she put the order together from the receipt He stated the order screen only holds orders for minutes Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another 
-1,Horrible service stood there for minutes trying to pay for my food Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others workers were in back play fighting Drive through line was around the building and over customers in line After minutes asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by register she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds 
-1,We shouldn t even be waiting for fast food more than minutes For order of chicken nuggets Please Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks I mean i know fast food isn t easy but damn minutes really give me a break Staff is extreamly slow Won t be back 
-1,How hard is it to give us the unsweetened tea we ordered instead of sweet tea We got on the hwy took the first sip and realized the ineptitude of the staff Too late to turn around 
-1,Waited minutes in the drive thru and then they started turning cars away Would ve loved to go somewhere else but the options were sparse at AM Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service 
-1,Horrible food bag the chicken sandwich came in had a disgusting almost like a gasoline smell and the sandwich was not warm at all and the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting around for a very good amount of time I threw it away immediately and spit out the bite I had in my mouth disgusting disappointing and I stopped visiting the McDonald s on hwy Cantonment because of bad food and sloppy service and this one on pine forest rd Pensacola will be on my McDonald s never to visit too 
-1,Waited in line for mins to get to order and they said that everything was broken and were taking cash only Nice I wasn t even mad just disappointed 
-1,I d like to start off by saying so far I love the employees they have great attitudes they act professional and real kind So I stop by almost every morning and have come to realize their apples pies are often hard as a rock This is becoming to be a real problem at this location They also don t put the best by stickers on them I 
-1,If I could give this less than star I absolutely would I spent minutes in line just to get meals and ice creams for my kids Waited minutes just to pay and another to get our food Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone The sad part I didn t have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered 
-1,Warning avoid this location at all costs Truly one of the worst McDonald s in the nation There s always an issue in the drive through there s always an issue when you go inside the store The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the ruled is Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald s conference in Orlando Florida If I could give them negative stars I would When you go through the drive through there is not a proper greeting It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order There is no quality service It s all about quantity instead of quality 
-1,Employees I dealt with were rude When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong The girl went to the back and came back with the right order didn t say anything or make eye contact just handed me the bag This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment fast food or not I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonald s than deal with what I had to deal with 
-1,Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonald s Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at pm waited and waited drive through backed up people inside waiting absolute chaos Finally at pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave Literally minutes for coffee Horrible experience short staffed and totally out of control 
-1,I usually frequent McDonald s at least once a week whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one This visit was probably the worst I ve experienced I ordered my food at AM A mcgriddle a coffee and two hashbrowns Once I paid I was immediately told to go to so I did After waiting until AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other After handing me my bag I asked about my drink and she said What drink I said the coffee that s listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me I waited an additional minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee Needless to say my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book Coming from a long time McDonalds customer I wont be back again 
-1,Wish I could give a ZERO food was horrible and the whole order was wrong paid extra for cheese no cheese no mayonnaise on anything Food was cold and to top it off the dime size tomatoes on each sandwich sandwiches and were right cant post the pictures on here or I would service unacceptable

-1,Ordered a spicy chicken sandwich bit into the sandwich and it was a bit hard to chew the sandwich was undercooked not happy with this at all 
-1,It was already a bad experience from the moment I met the window attendant at Pickup She told me we ran out of eggs and just left me there at the window without telling me they were making more Then she came back s few minutes later and handed me my food Big Breakfast which is supposed to come with OJ and I asked for salt and pepper and she said it was already in the bag which it is NOT and then shut the window in my face The meat wasn t fully cooked and the eggs still runnie I walked in to find out she is the actual manager I told her I was about to shut the window in my face I was gonna ask for Ketchup She then snarkley replied I didn t shut the window in your face Have a nice day 
-1,Just went through the drive thru young lady at payment window needs additional training on what is considered proper customer care She was having a full on conversation with a coworker related to a personal matter candy she had sitting on the counter next to her the other coworker indicated she had a customer to which she stated I dont care She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished Never said hello or thank you Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease I should have driven a quarter mile up the road to Wendys Shameful

-1,Spent over minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around pm Finally placed my order of egg mcmuffins Recieved egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast The white portion of the egg was almost black They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from hours prior 
-1,Horrible service waited over min for my cold food No one wanted to speak up but i did manager turns around and tells me we are short staffed but no excuse for them dragging their feet and cracking jokes to each other total opposite of a FAST food joint I would of had better luck and service an actual sit down place

-1,WORST MCDONALD S EVER unfortunately I cannot leave less then star They have automatic screens to place your order from but only if you want breakfast cant order lunch from them A completely waste of my time and money Your better off going across the street to Burger King and getting a whopper 
-1,The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldn t give it ZERO we ordered on a kiosk at McDonald s because the counter line was too long Come to find out it s because the kiosks weren t taking payment I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food When I asked for a refund for my friend s food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than mins and said it s coming Uh no Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonald s

-1,It took minutes for them to make double cheeseburgers I asked the manager Daniel why he said they just completed a large online order I told him this was the nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say Terrible location regardless of how busy it is it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty dirty tables and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude 
-1,Seriously you have one job Ordered a stake egg and cheese on a bagel they served it on a biscuit Ordered a egg McMuffin served a Sausage egg McMuffin Best part about it A MANAGER walked it out to my car Y

-1,We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it Now it s just a boring modern McDonald s with bleh service The remodel was a mistake and if you re going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves Probably won t come back during our zoo trips anymore

-1,After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week we stopped off at this McDonald s location to get us a late night dinner I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies sad face As we pulled away from the drive thru and continued on our way to our final destination we realized that they gave us the wrong order We spent about but only received maybe worth of food The lobby was closed the line was long and we were too tired to turn back I tried calling this location more than times and even submitted a complaint help request via the McDonald s app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts 
-1,They have destroyed their animal themed building and now it s boring Not worth going to anymore Why are McDonald s creating such boring buildings What a waste of money It doesn t make sense It s as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away

-1,We bought food and drinks with the kids After playing in the play place we tried to get refills on our sodas and were told they do not offer refills and we would have to buy another There were no signs or anything stating such and I ve never seen another McDonald s telling people this so I m pretty sure the worker just lied to us

-1,Normally every experience I ve had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees weren t in the best mood Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again The staff very unwilling to help over hearing a conversation with another customer a Hispanic father and young daughter trying to pick up a order and knowing very little English the employee being rude and acting like she couldn t understand Just plain old being disrespectful that my husband had t
-1,Apparently when ordering counter pickup after or they don t allow you to and gotta go through drive through
-1,Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over minutes now they need to get better service 
-1,The App let s you order breakfast and pay ahead but when you show up and it s their system won t let them complete your order The location is relatively good the employees are always friend and fast But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate office app devs and need to either decide to prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the shut off or allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order minutes after it s no longer breakfast time I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at on the way to work 
-1,Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds

-1,Zari was absolutely incompetent We specifically ordered meals to be placed in separate bags during the first stage of ordering as they were for people When we requested this again at her window she rolled her eyes huffed and began changing them out She also gave me Cokes and diet Coke for the diabetic in the group They didn t mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health

-1,Went today after the zoo it was a very bad experience to say the least We were given over seasoned fries one straw for three drinks and the drinks were all bad I thought how do you mess up a drink It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits I mean really sour The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids Will not ever return 
-1,Doesn t deserve one star Waited in line minutes When we finally ordered the girl couldn t get the order right after attempts When we got to the pay window the girl was talking on her cell phone When I asked her to repeat my order she looked at me crazy When we got our order it was disgusting Soggy oily fries burned chicken nuggets water down soda plain disgusting They need new management for sure Someone please contact corporate

-1,My wife and I was going to this McDonald s for some morning when they had another crew But here recently they changed the morning to a new crew an old man a young vanity lady at the drive through window that is very rude This crew need to be removed They never seemed to know how to work and prepare your order in a timely manner This facility is also made where you can t just get out of line in the drive through which is very dangerous if a car stalls or a real emergency arrives We will be skipping visiting the morning crew Plz change crew or train them better 
-1,Would have have it a negative if possible I have went to this location for the last time Drive through you will sit at the speaker for minutes before they even say anything to you but you can hear them talking laughing and cursing to each other POOR MANAGEMENT THEN my order was wrong so I go inside to get a refund only to see my receipt had about streks of ink on it nothing legible SO I go inside and say I would like my money back and the manager just shrugs me off like it doesn t effect her If you are going to the Dallas Zoo drive further and don t let this McDonald s ruin your day TRUST ME

-1,The drive thru took forever and it was p The young attendant felt the need to chat with the car in front of me for a full mins Doesn t sound ridiculous until you re sitting there watching it with a full line of impatient cars behind you Then when I pulled up the kid realized he never handed back the guy s credit card and started laughing about it His co worker was shaking her head saying it was cuz you got distracted talking to him about guns for so long To add insult to injury I got my food I had to remind the kid about my drinks that I ordered I left and my food was cold and my order was wrong 
-1,A worker called MY order number so obviously I m gonna grab it It didn t even occur to me to look at the tray the only thing I noticed was that I was missing a coffee so I set the tray on the table and on my way back I see the manager yelling at my family about how WE grabbed the wrong order and see at first we tried being cool about it She said she was taking back the extra food and we said that was fine so then she starts grabbing the food we ordered and says we weren t charged for that after an interesting conversation we establish that my receipt clearly said I was charged Ten minutes later they ve manned to give two BIG orders but haven t managed to give me a bacon egg mcgriddle So eventually I get the burger and as the manager hands it to me she s telling a worker she gave us hash browns I obviously heard her and said no ma am we got this same manager then has the audacity to say we already ate them At this point I m pissed I ve been accused of not paying for my part of the food I m hungry I ve waited way too long the manager has an attitude AND she s a accusing my family of eating hash browns in less than a minute NEVER eating at this McDonald s again Especially with a manager like that 
-1,I eat at this McDonalds at least times a week Never again The service is always questionable and the drive thru order is screwed up as often as not Had to wait at drive thru order full minutes before giving my order That s at the speaker not in line Was told rather rudely to wait several times When given the order the server practically threw the bag at me and disappeared When I got to work I found I had to eat my hotcakes with no plasticware no syrup or butter and not even a napkin Calls placed to the store went unanswered Poor service all around 
-1,Worst experience ever They closed the lobby early Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job

-1,Bunch of zombies working here The lady at the drive thru window is sitting down while there s a line that doesn t move Absolutely no urgency 
-1,Id give it zero starts if I could The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in It was not that busy at all and it had at least people working At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case
-1,Just horribly slow Waited minutes to get to the order screen at the drive thru even though only two cars ahead of us in the right lane It took another minutes to get my kid s food It really makes no sense

-1,Was basically out of half the menu Then we had them repeat back our dollar order to us twice and once we got back to our hotel sandwiches were missing While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didn t reach out the window I ve NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life Not a single employee had on a uniform Just a total messed up experience
-1,We wait in the line for over min When we arrive employees were outside the store speaking The worst drive thru service ever 
-1,If you like to have your order messed up having people mumbling at you and don t care about getting any sauce with your nuggets this place is for you The crack heads hanging out in the drive through is also a nice touch although based on my experience those might just be workers on their break Oh and the fries so old and stale they would make a great 
-1,Terrible In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they don t do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair her hoody on her head then take it off and scratch hair again Not once did she wash her hands but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didn t ring up the order correctly Definitely will not be coming back to this one I m glad I m on my way back home to Texas so I can get some Southern Hospitality 
-1,Not hours more so when I feel like working especially late night They sit inside and let a line build up and don t respond to multiple hellos I don t get it Customer service does not exist
-1,I never leave reviews but I had to here Honestly if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last I spent an hour in the drive thru and when I got to the window it took minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest in what they were doing It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion it was a sight to see Then when I finally did get my food the order it was of course not correct But the weird thing is they didn t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but 
-1,DO NOT GO As soon as I got in I got yell at by one of their employees to get out and go to through the drive thru I told her I did not have a car and she told me to wait in the line anyways I standed in the line for cars and they took forever to make any orders After my order was done they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car The two cars behind me had bigger orders I am talking delivery bags They yelled at me they basically threw the food at me and I left with the worst experience Is not fast food if you have to wait minutes just to order 
-1,They never have anything Their Menu is always crossed out and when you order something 
-1,Second time in less than weeks apart More than minutes waiting in the drive thru because these guys take the wrong orders A complete disaster 
-1,I move close to this unit ordered via app to avoid the drive thru line but for my surprise when I went to get my order that was ready I was forced to take an hour in the drive thru line This is supposed to be fast food When I went to pick up my order the drinks were wrong the potatoes were the wrong size and old the Sundae machine was broken they didn t deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude saying that the problem was mine and not hers burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasn t in the bag The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donald s app was greater than the closing of the order I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken Never had a more disappointed experience estaurant again 
-1,Horrible experience I ordered the Saweetie mea just tryna support my girl and several flies flew out of my bag I am disgusted beyond belief All the food was cold and old on top of that Completely inedible McDonald 
-1,Food was fresh and fast however the lady working at the drive through window was rude and nasty beyond belief Her disgusting long fake curly weave was not put up and she kept flinging it around as we watched it dip into many of the drinks She was too busy putting on lip gloss and rolling around a fat piece of gum him her mouth Very rude at the window and impolite to her manager Health department would have a field day with this Sorry excuse for a worker 
-1,They need to shut down this Mc Donald or sell it to a different management Worst service ever 
-1,The young ladies that work during the day are too busy chit chatting and texting and making the coffees wrong Cashier at the drive thru window literally handed me my receipt with her head down and other hand texting Very irritated that I paid for two coffees and it wasn t until I reached my next destination that I realized that they were made completely wrong Ladies making the coffee were talking and laughing and didn t say hello or thank you Very rude 
-1,Update updating to stars Was at the drive through for over mins today Cars were leaving the line bc it wasn t moving Got on the lane and no one came to the speaker I left Customer Service is terrible Starting from when you get to the ordering screen Drive thru employees never greet you never thank you they look tired and moody There is one or two exceptions I did look at the name badge because I was surpri
-1,Disgusting as always I think they pre make the burgers a day ahead the bread cheese and the patty is old fries fells still frozen lol or they wish to be frozen
-1,They served a bucket of stale oil instead of a clean batch of fries and a filet o fish The patty was stale hard possibly refried and the oil quality was very poor The fried weren t fresh but sometimes this happens with door dash But the quality of the oil and the staleness of the food was unreal Regret not making the choice for pizza tonight could even eat this food

-1,Service is slow The neighborhood is so bad they have security in the lobby A person has to wonder just how safe is it to stop and dine here Lock your car Leave nothing if value in view Broken window glass in the parking lot
-1,Do NOT go to this McDonald s if you re in a hurry We were just picking up a drink so it wasn t a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting min for his chicken sandwich He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said man you can see we busy Also note that this was the only McDonald s we encountered in Florida that doesn t offer any size soft drinks 
-1,Terrible establishment Slow af Incredibly long lines Waited in line for minutes I m the drive thru for them to tell me they aren 
-1,Staff are busy talking and they don t care about customers And they make us wait for long time at drive through all the time When I called at the store they picked up the call But when I start complain about this situations they hung up on my face This McDonald used to be so good and professional I don t know what happened since they changed to new staff got worse 
-1,Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted Then look surprised when I told her The manager should not let her work drive thru Which explains why the line was so long I m sure I m not the only order she screwed up Don t normally post these comments but it s becoming more of the norm these days 
-1,This McDonald s needs to close I ve ordered times in months and had correct order Don t order delivery go yourself and check the bag before you leave 
-1,no stars this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered minutes in the drive thru I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food I ask the manager for her name and she walks away at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday around pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have cars in the drive thru
-1,They have the worst manger ever One of them have a lack of speaking which is Arlene Ledesma She doesn t know what is being said to her You can t get your point across because she won t understand Can t handle the customers and she s very disrespectful 
-1,I live feet away and waited an hour to place an order This is supposed to be fast food Never had a more disappointed experience with McDonald 
-1,Biscayne Blvd and th Street Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drive thru window with employees one who couldn t even understand or speak English I made a complaint to McDonald s yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owner s organization The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski CEO of McDonald s as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonald s in Chicago They need to understand why McDonald s is doing so poorly afterall when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service I will not be going to this or any other McDonald s again It was that bad McDonald s corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers The owner clearly must put numbers before people Horrible horrible experience Will stick with Wendy s instead They have much better food and service As a follow up to my complaint to McDonald s and the CEO I did receive a written response and phone call Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonald s I will add that although I had been to this McDonald 
-1,For the third time in the morning this is happened to me the drive through lady does not answer I drove around the front this morning and they had about four employees there looking at me One of them gave me a thumbs up to go back to the drive through which I did and it was the same result the lady did not answer and finally I decided I would leave and right before I left she answered by saying one moment please so I waited hey moment and she still was not ready so I just left There have been two vehicles in the drive through before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience I believe the employees are slacking off in the morning which is difficult for me because if I don t have breakfast then I have to wait hours at work before they allow me to go eat

-1,Just needed caffeine The staff at the drive thru just shoved the drink in my hands Not very professional 
-1,Doesn 
-1,This location is wack They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like minutes until a m so that they don t get to order dinner food anymore We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the Drive Thru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over Look McDonald s if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldn t have shown up at in the morning thank you 
-1,We hit it off pretty good in the beginning everything was great but that didn t last long I mean the service is fast but with attitude an
-1,I ordered a Large fry buy after arriving to my destination I saw they did not fill the carton up They gave me a small portion for what I paid for This is not right and management needs to correct this Stealing from customers is plain wrong When ordering a large they expect to get what should come in a large I noticed after my bad experience that your reviews are low In order order to create a good business giving people an exceptional experience should be your goal not the opposite 
-1,I placed an order the young lady at the drive thru kept having issues getting the order correctly I paid for my order went to the second window was given a huge bag that almost broke through with stuff I pulled up just a little bit to check my order noticed I was missing an item fries so I pulled around to let the lady at the first window know I m missing something she just dismissed me to the nd window and the ladies at the second window weren t the best either When I stated I drove back around because I was missing my fries I didn t realize my receipt was in the bag to confirm my order found it and gave it to one of the ladies the second lady I m guessing to be heard due to my inconvenience of my order not being correct for her to take ownership for what possibly could of went wrong and show some compassion instead of being kind of prude after I received the fries the manager dismissed me with a condescending 
-1,They get an extra Star because their staff of have been polite Drive through has issues They constantly get order wrong Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes They are new I understand training new people But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat times to make sure they get it right Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket Not just a quarter pounder Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them Numerous times their fries have been under cooked 
-1,McDonald s is usually pretty bad about inventory shorts especially The BBQ sauce it s just a conspiracy but if you ever been a lover of Mcys Nuggets then you know they tend to Forget the BBQ sauce Any other sauce and it s in there But overall I dont see my self going back anytime soon 
-1,Very stringent on providing Ketchup Last visits I ve been given only 
-1,We went through the drive through and ordered bacon cheese burgers and big Mac s and we asked for them to leave the middle part the bread in the center We got the bacon cheese burgers and they were fine But the big Mac s not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with mac sause on them So instead of pieces of meat and pieces of bread I ended with pieces of meat and pieces of bread I was not amused when I got home You can bet that I will NOT EVER stop there again 
-1,Always busy sort of slow but not too slow Dangerous intersection when leaving the drive thru The food the couple of times I have been here seemed old or dry it wasn t bad just not very good 
-1,Id only eat from here if there is no other option Its on a good location since its kinda on my way from work to home I finish work at am so i have literally no other option cause i am exhausted and not willing to drive further Burgers are dry patties are old i got nuggets instead of In short dont waste your money cook yourself at home 
-1,I work late nights so I come here after my shift which is well after midnight It s rare I have a good experience when the overnight staff is running the show Missing items the quality of the food is just not good clearly it s been sitting there for a while and it just seems like they have difficulty getting my order I get that it 
-1,No worries about the time difference between us and I just asking you about the fact you have any idea what
-1,Not a big deal but the guy at the window on drive through said there were more then NBA sauces in the bag I said ok and went home Got home and there was nothing in the bag Just double check everything even of they say it there Probably wont go back to that location again 
-1,Does anyone ever expect to go there for the awesome food and beyond superior customer service Nope It s the only place with a decent sausage biscuit without having to drive to Carl JR s in cedar park 
-1,Completely ignored me when I was waiting for them to take my order at the register 
-1,Kiosk is a joke Takes longer using it than just ordering at the counter Young lady behind the counter obviously did not want to be at work She wasn 
-1,Chicken sandwiches just lazily thrown together Looks really sloppy Have to take apart and line it all up and spread out the veggies Your typical McDonald s 
-1,Food was cold Taste like it had sat there for a while Very disappointed 
-1,Just got back from extremely long drive through Cold fries and dry old nuggets Whataburger is around the corner 
-1,Drive thru very slow stop bye after work took about minutes to get food and that s at am 
-1,My order is most always incorrect from here when ordering from grub hub
-1,First time in McDonalds listening to mexican music and felt like a street taqueria in Tijuana eating a burger 
-1,The fries are the best Please bring back the Hi c 
-1,No pride in their service any more 
-1,The dining is NOT hrs only the drive thru is
-1,Asked me to leave saying my dog was not allowed on their outdoor patio
-1, they wouldn t allow my service dog in
-1,It s a little sketchy there is a small encampment nearby
-1,Fries were stale and customer service was poor
-1,Food is gross but it s cheap

-1,Brodheadsville Pa Last time this location forgot my wife s soda I m disabled and can t stand long so I take advantage of the curbside delivery through the app They don t have salads anymor
-1,Curbside is unavailable for all hours McDonald s app freezes in order screen frequently at this particular location I have great service with AT t and new phones so I don t think it s on my end I have had multiple issues with old orders trying to reprocess old orderss here leading to wrong food being ready at the window staff more interested in proving to me that what came through from the app was what they prepared chicken nuggets for three people Is not adequate They did not offer to even take a new order I left with NO food
-1,It s not the best like it was years ago but not as bad as it has been in the past They have to work out the mobile app ordering They lose orders plus app says they re out of food 
-1,Sorry to rate you a two but just years ago you would of been rated a five You changed your fries and they are thinner and not as good and when you got a spicy chicken sandwich it was a spicy patty and came with lettuce and tomato now it is a crispy chicken patty with spicy sauce and pickles where is the lettuce and tomato oh you have to order a deluxe You are getting cheaper with the food and the prices go up Not pleased very disappointed 
-1,I was glad to hear McDonald s lowered their coffee frappe prices they were having a special sale I had to repeat a simple two step iced coffee order SEVERAL times The drive thru worker was distraught as I gave back st one made wrong Another employee finished order by running out to car I questioned the workers about the cost size of my drink all said it was med size turned out to be a SMALL they got me a few weeks ago on that Girl who ran out order was ONLY ONE who acted professionally provided great customer service SADLY the iced coffee prices are low because drink is so small if they could charge a fair price they would have a new regular 
-1, for breakfast Never again I ll make my own at home Ordered Sausage McMuffin with egg hash browns small coffee Requested creamers and sugars on the side What I get Cream and sugar already mixed in Guess they don t pay attention to what they re hearing over the headsets 
-1,Drive thru experience was bad they got our order wrong or gave our order to someone else When I addressed this after waiting for over minutes they said yeah we 
-1,The food was barely warm The cheese was cold and hard They threw my bag of food up on the counter What a dysfunctional restaurant 
-1,Well i order a crispy chicken sandwich small fry and a coke Normally I look in the bag this time I just reached in for a fry When I get home I find piece nugget two BBQ sauces and a double cheese burger I was to far to go back so I ate nuggets and half the burger Check your food people I was very disappointed but my dogs were thrilled 
-1,Usually always good but today was a lil different My girlfriend went thru the drive thru and ordered a piece nuggets and only got a piece They never read back the order like the people alway did before So there was no way to correct the mistake Plus they didn 
-1,Prices are much high than other McDonalds in the area Wind Gap Soda always seems off never tastes the same or even good A few of the employees are pleasant but there are a few who are just rude 
-1,Slowest place and folks do t care 
-1,Food was alright Wasn t really hot and my husband s bagel was stale But it was ok I guess The place was trashed Not one clean table and garbage everywhere yet we were the only ones in the place the whole time we ate and very few people were going through drive thru There were two managers on no one thought to clean Can t blame it on being busy Cashier was new and a bit rude We ordered three meals She rang everything up separate but left off our hash browns Manager made us pay to get our hash browns Forget that it was all way more expensive cause of how she rang it up to begin with then the cashier kept telling the manager in front of us that we never said we wanted meals even though when I repeatedly told her we wanted meals she kept saying sure I can make that a meal for you Completely unprofessional and we left feeling disgusted by the whole experience 
-1,I ordered online paid got the code when I went to pick up the food the lady said they didn t get the order so I said ok then i will order again but she didn t want to accept my coupon Not good experience 
-1,Ehhh Mcdonald really isnt something I do a lot and last time it wasn t good Fries were cold burger sucked Even my drink was wrong so I wasnt happy with my last meal here 
-1,Food order wrong and cold This place is on a downward spiral Used to love coming here because my order WAS hot when I got it and correct My sister and I go on french fry dates and McDonald s fries are our favorite Hard to find good McDonald s fries any more hatescoldfries
-1,The bun was dry the fries weren t the same I ll pass But the Hi C orange was good 
-1,It s McDonald s for the love of God get the order right st of all nd of all put some napkins and utensils in the bag salt and pepper wouldn t kill you what apparently don t go to the drive through because you orders not gonna get done right and egg mcmuffin should not look like to sources rig muffins then you go inside and it takes you another minutes to get U dam order it s McDonald s for the love of God just pay attention I understand the pool that you have to pick from for help is very thin and limited
-1,Time for McDonald s to open their doors for indoor seating Pricing is getting out of hand as well Can go to red Robin for more and sit down to eat 
-1,This place is always so slow Went through the drive thru with only cars in front of me Took minutes to get my food and they had four drinks prepared on the counter but mine wasn t one of them Almost charged me for the wrong order too since they don t seem to be able to keep track of them well 
-1,The lobby is open but you stand there for quite some time before your order gets taken All attention is on drive thru
-1,Food was fine tho I have reason to believe it was spit in Also when I requested the inspection report as the sign clearly specifies I was given a nasty look and was completely ignored by the cashier named Greta 
-1,The Google info says open hours It s not Pulled up at am and just sat to use wifi After a little while the morning crew came in and out up cones on all the parking spots near me It was very strange 
-1,Morning staff is good afternoon evening is a different story They take the fast out of fast food 
-1,The food handlers were picking up the plastic bag of shack mix with gloves off of the FLOOR on then going back to food handling You ve got to be kidding me What are you wearing gloves for 
-1,If there s more than cars in drive thru line keep driving unless you like overcooked hollow French fries 
-1,Good deals and friendly service most of the time The drive thru wait time is always very long 
-1,This McDonald s is really going downhill service is slow biscuits overcooked and crunchy bacon burned and the place is a mess Couldn t find a clean table 
-1,They charge more there than my local Mc D in Windgap cents more for a large Mocha Frappie in Brodheadsville never again
-1,You would find the Covid vaccine here before you found a working ice cream machine
-1,They threw me and my friends out that were doing business and not buying anything
-1,Food was ok Waited too long to get my food
-1,Inconsistent inconsistent that s the truth Also they don t clean the edges of the booths Gross
-1,Service is hit or miss Give you fries that are half full 
-1,Hash browns are always cold and under cooked 
-1,Ordered a large fry and they were burnt had to go back and they were still overdone
-1,Even after expressing items that were missing they still got it wrong
-1, minutes in drive thru Ridiculous
-1,Consistently bad as we Have become conditioned to expect and except 
-1,They always mess up my order
-1,It s ok if in hurry for food for supper
-1,Mickey D s is just what it is

-1,The service was horrible The kiosk machine printed a record with no numbers on it The staff was calling numbers without saying the order The atmosphere was Workers waiting for their checks requesting food infront of paying customers Was a very unpleasant experience 
-1,I ve gone twice after work around and my food is served cold n the most recent they gave me my food n not my drink had to tab on window multiple times to get someone s attention to then be questioned about it as if they didn t just give me my food n they watered down the drink because I guess they didn t like having to come back and finish the order I hate to down talk a business but your a fast food chain such things should not be happening 
-1,I ordered a piece nugget and only got nuggets Food was nice and hot though
-1,I did the Drive though the food was warm and it was turn off 
-1,Decent McDonalds but I would prefer avoiding this one especially at certain times after school hours Lunch maybe And some evenings it is packed with unbearably loud and annoying kids teens sometimes even adults There are some nice employees but the order is always wrong Food is consistently good though 
-1,Always very disappointing I ve gone to this McDonald s for years now The system has gotten more organized since the recent renovation but it seems the efficiency still has not improved The workers are nice and willing to help The seating area is much better The biggest issue would be the lack of efficient service I ve seen people leave after ordering because it would take so long Hopefully it ll be improved 
-1,Ordered Uber Eats No drinks or cookies were in my order Cold food 
-1,In store experience is generally better than delivery Order breakfast for my whole family all that was delivered was orange juices When I asked the driver he said he even asked if there was any food and stated the employee said no Not sure who would only order orange juices for the trouble and price the corner store juice is way better Deliveries need to be handled better not the first time missing items or a whole order 
-1,They are not hrs them doors are locked after pm open at AM Breakfast Ends at AM they just backwards
-1,Double check your orders before leaving Twice in one week I ve ordered different meals and when I get home Only half my meal is here 
-1,I like the convenience of this McDonald s for parking and drive thru the food is fresh and the place is clean though I think because of the Covid increase they don t let anybody sit inside My problem is the workers organization Nobody is at the register or someone to help you at the kiosk One kiosk machine did not give you a receipt another gives you just a white paper Long wait to pick up order took like minutes Once you get your order it is missing items from your order Today I was missing hashbrowns I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee instead I did not change it because two weeks ago the same thing happened and I had to wait more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate I thought that was an isolated incident but it happened again today For this reason I m not coming back to this place ever again Goodbye 
-1,Well we went for breakfast first off all the girl at the front wanted us to use the ordering machines to place our order and than presided to say that they didn t sell breakfast past am so the manager than said to place oder by the register which that is what we wanted to do in the first place we ll we ordered finely and than to realize that gave us half of what we ordered 
-1,It s a busy place Employees are not very friendly I only come to this location for the convenience but they usually very slow I always need to check my orders before I leave because they frequently missing stuffs or got it wrong 
-1,Table service is chaotic They walk around with your food on a tray searching for you for minutes It can be better organized The fountain soda was watery and needed it s syrup changed and it went ignored The open floor pl
-1,This McDonald s had a full makeover but the customer service has went down since then Today was the second time in two weeks that they got my order all the way wrong I
-1,What the owner should monitor is the attitudes of spanich servers she has nasty attitute she is on the heavy side i don t know her name we were just asking for an xtra ketsups bcause the kids askd for it n her reply was omg nasty 
-1,I m allergic to onions I tell them every single time to not add onions and for the last visits my burgers continue to have onions put on I end up switching my meal with my wife because she doesn t want me to get sick or go hungry I worked at McDonald s its not that difficult to build a burger without adding onions DO BETTER 
-1,I only come here late at night Staff do okay they seem pretty busy with drive through or other tasks The dining room stays dirty for a long time while the cashiers are helping out behind the line even if there are only a few customers 
-1,Use the drive through to order The girl gave me the wrong flavor soda I told her what i ordered and she gets angry and says ok pull up to the next window for your soda I say no I ll wait here please just give me my soda She would rather argue then just fill the cup with soda She tells me that I m making everyone in the drive through wait I said no McDonald s sloppy order taking is making me wait I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up They do that so corporate doesn t yell at them for having slow initial order to window pickup time Do the job right and orders will be fast 
-1,Tl Dr poor service frequently gets orders wrong We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald s We always have an issue at this McDonald s no matter what time of day whether we order from a food delivery service or in person The orders always get screwed up from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we d probably never go here again But today I finally understood why it s a mess there s no communication It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about minutes waiting for a Dr Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he d just placed in the row of other drinks he d been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr Pepper and he said yes it was a Coke Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication especially when it s busy Yes it s just a McDonald s and I m not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint but our community deserves better than what we re getting for sure 
-1,The best thing about this McDonald s is the cleanliness compared to most McD restaurants in Queens The worst thing about it is the staff They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isn t even busy in the slightest Sometime they don t give me my receipt Sometime my order will be ready in the bag but they ll set it aside and realize it much later as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long and it turns out my order was read all along they just never bother to call the number I can go on and on almost everyday it s something different Two stars is the best I can do 
-1,Never get my order right in the drive through then told to pull over we will bring your food in a moment Defeated the whole point of the drive thru experiance dont you think If it wasnt for my child wanting his happy meal I myself always make it a point to skip this place 
-1,Missing items in order on You guys need to pay attention it 
-1,Food is good but the customer service is terrible They always have an attitude I rather drive mins further to the other McDonalds I don 
-1,This McDonalds is ok but in the morning I always have to worry about whether they are going to do my coffee right The other day they gave me black coffee when i asked for light and sweet Situations like this is a regular occurance In addition there is a male manager there who yells at his employees all the time Once he pounded on the drive through window and yelled toward me to get my attention Not a very nice gesture at all 
-1,This place is known to always get your order wrong or they ask you to pull over so they can bring it out Today my order was missing something when I asked why the person at the window gave me an attitude and asked me pull out By the way the person who took the order had a headset and she was on her phone 
-1,I Placed my order on the app on and paid for meal through the app when I got close to the restaurant I place my order after arriving minutes later my order was still not ready I stood at the pick up counter and had to fine someone to help me which took another five minutesThere was absolutely no one at the counter to help
-1,Not so good Order drive through but found out to food is not what I order extra charge Play ground is poor maintained It is much worse now compared to my visit eleven years ago 
-1,Poor customer service doesn 
-1,Not a very pleasant McDonald s to visit the area for the lines is small So expect to be cramped when it s busy and be confused as to where the lines are and where they start the employees are not friendly I wouldn t say they re mean but they obviously don t care about any pleasantries or seem to care about you there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins or ketchup or straws You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils during lunch time when lines are longer and it s getting congested at the counter it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something I don t recommend coming here if you want to stop and relax for food 
-1,I recommend going here if you ve ever cut me in line chewed loudly during a movie or screwed me over in general as this place tends to take longer than most and taste worse too I ve gotten some poor service on multiple occasions I d say I won t ever be back but this McDonalds is open late and too close to my house 
-1,I m doing Door Dash The servers are young they spend a lot of time talking to each other and Not paying attention to the window Door Dash items are on the counter Waiting to be passed to drivers 
-1,Well They finally put the right prices up on the drive thru menu I asked for a coffee with milk with my meal they said what size I said whatever is included with the meal They gave me a medium with cream and charged ne an extra 
-1,It looks clean food is like any other McDonald s Disappointed the playhouse is not there anymore That really made this place worth going to Gave the community ties to this particular mc Donald s I ll be going to the one thats closer to my house from now on R I P RONALD MC DONALDS PLAY HOUSE SINCE I COULD REMEMBER 
-1,New renovated McDonald s but the food taste old I bought an
-1,This McDonald s has horrible service for the morning breakfast they will make you late for work Their morning management and workers need much more improvement they make you wait as long as minutes to receive your order Don t go to this McDonald s unless you plan on being late to work 
-1,I went to get iced coffee this morning and they say we dont have iced coffee 
-1,Disappointed They constantly mess up orders I ordered sweet tea without ice they gave me un sweet tea with ice

-1,Will will not much new store but Amy sill there I left this store in as a assistant manager And never went back to the store till now years later and I 
-1,Was great but now they no longer stay open late Have to go to another one in next town over Inconvenient 
-1,service is good but I would recommend cashier to change their gloves when touching money cleaning counter and then touching food at the same time 
-1,Possibly the worst Mcdonalds in Queens The service is absolutely terrible I saw a rat in between the two entrance doors The employees had done nothing about it Disgusting 
-1,No refills on drinks owner keeps ac on low making it hot inside School kids sit at all seats taking up space and are noisy 
-1,Always seem to end up with missing items from my order 
-1,This McDonald s has a group of homeless people that take up many seats by the bathrooms Unfortunately they add a bad odor to the area where they congregate 
-1,They still mess up your orders and don t give you any condiments
-1,Standard iced black coffee from Northern Blvd little neck store Give your employees a reference 
-1,Store now sucks very few items on menu at high prices rude cashier

-1,The Atmosphere must change Too much homelessness 
-1,They disabled the order kiosks by taking away all the number tents and requiring them Then i get in a line which is designed to handle the overflow not the whole store cashiers and people Nice long wait Then they didn t give my mcflurry a mix at all If i wanted a cup of vanilla ice cream with oreo topping i wouldn t have ordered a mcflurry

-1,Restrooms weren t available 
-1,A very busy McDonald s Whay under staffed One young man seemed to be doing all the work involving the food While they left a inexperienced young lad on the register She told me my daughter could not have a Dr Pepper cause it was not a drink choice for the cheeseburger meal This sounded absurd so when I asked her to explain this she told me no we are just out of it She was supper sweet and at this point I came to realize only her and the other young man were the only working As the manager sat there holding a mop and did literally nothing for min So many McDonald s in NYC and this one was in all Honesty just AWFUL 
-1,Its pretty much yhe same as most mcdonalds in the city least this one is kept clean only unpleasant sights are all the homeless dirtbags and all the drug addicts that hang around in front and beg for money indide just walk right up to people while their eating ask for money beg for your food other then that pretty good for a coty McDonalds 
-1,On McDonalds I ve ever been to that has a security guard Does not let you pee before you order Other than that the place is clean and fine 
-1,Just bad service wasn t busy but the food took mins
-1,The store is up to date very small and with exception of a few the staff sucks The few taking orders cool the people getting the food the worst Period 
-1,Its ok could be better i say its just to many homeless people dine un n have a bad smell of sweat n people get high in bathroom n leave needle n bags of drugs on floor dirty at time smell homeless people askin for money harass people who eat in McDonalds
-1,We had to ask for our order because people before us were getting served and there were employees in the back cursing and being loud with each other Very uncomfortable experience

-1,My breakfast sandwich bread was so burnt it was inedible 
-1,Went in for a sprite how can u have nasty sprite wasted Probably one of the dirtiest McDonalds I have been to

-1,The food was good the speed of the order to withdraw online was fine but it was a McDonald s worker came in and told us in a very bad way that we had minutes to finish eating and we had just started eating 
-1,The truth is that in the USA in Queens they don t even let you sit in a drive tru it s very ugly 
-1,You get your food stowed in a bag as standard whether you want to eat in or take it with you Sauce on the Mc fish fillet also oilier than normal Furthermore this Mc on th street was dingy

-1, pm pm stars for Juan who was a very understanding manager and who completely tries satisfying customer needs by keeping open the restroom for us However the lady working on cleaning duty resisted obeying Juan s orders and consciously tried to stop us from using the restroom by creating excuses to the manager such as cleaning time and no paper towels These hardships invented by 
-1,This is a below average McDonald s The self ordering machines don t print receipts with your number so you better catch it on the screen because they may or may not see it on the system Fortunately I was only getting some sodas and they didn t question my order but if it had been a real order it might not have gone smoothly 
-1,A friendly and responsive staff delivered twice after I brought it back coffee that was not hot After the second time I just gave my cup to my daughter whose iced coffee was way too light with cream and diluted Surprised that McDonalds quality control failed on this visit 
-1,It s dark It s dirty Carry your own napkins cuz they only give you or Everytime I ve gone the tables have been filthy so have something to wipe them down The food is always good though 
-1,Fast service but restroom being locked just avoid tourists using Should have been more organized with a sign for customers use only 
-1,Manager called me out for seating and eating my food at pm There were some seats available Closes at am If they don t want folks to sit they need to robe off all seats Manager allowed me to eat 
-1,This location tends to vary in quality If it s raining I would recommend you not go since they close the upstairs and the seating becomes scarce due to the campers taking up the front of the store When it s nice out it isn t much better though since the place is very dark and feels damp I how s think they are trying to help people not eat their food since it is a very unappetizing place to eat 
-1,I want there today and order a small fries and a chess burger the order came very fast but the cashier was with another customer she was taking order after she finish with customer she didn t even wash her hand or sanitized her hand or she used glove she want and start putting fires and giving it to customer I didn t even eat my fires its Covid time be careful 
-1,Oct morning they completely mixed up the order starting with the coffee Asked for black coffee opened the cup it had milk in it Ordered bagel bacon and egg and a bacon egg on biscuit both without cheese Got sausage and egg with cheese on bun Went back to switch was assured I got the right order Came to my table and realized again the order was mixed up tries to get the order right Really 
-1, different visits The supervisor in the grey shirt was the one give out the food with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered And I ordered apple pies at night and all of them were old dried out and their box had no sell by time stamped so who knows how long they been in that warmer Probably will place my food orders elsewhere
-1,They were cleaning surfaces while simultaneously serving food off them and i dont mean they were drying there was water sloshing And bizarrely my piece mcnugget order was ready and bagged up on the counter before I even paid I ordered at a kiosk so no one overheard my order and acted fast I got to the train station a block away and opened my food to find that my food was soggy and slightly brownish Dont eat here at night 
-1,They moved fast but it wasnt very crowded The food wasnt that good it was no salt on the fries and my burger was extrs salty Then they gave me orange soda because they didnt have strawberry fanta but thats def not what i wanted If im ever in the area i wont be coming back here 
-1,The cashiers seem to have no idea what is going on Mess up orders Literally give small portions Ordered a sandwich and they gave me one of smallest chicken that i ve seen I wouldn t recommend this place Find a better McDonalds around 
-1,Food was the bog standard biggest issues here are The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting There are three lines and there be nobody serving in the other They messed up my order seems to be the case in every McDonald s in NYC they seem to miss out of the things on my order that being fries or drink Wouldn t recomend 
-1,I ordered hot chocolate on machine and when I went to the pickup they told me it was sold out And the floor is really dirty Clearly this restaurant is out of management 
-1,The food was ok but the staff were just rude and have no idea of what customers are The security guard was a good man tho 
-1,The slowest service I have ever experienced Even after ordering online I wait for far to long for pick up 
-1,Machines where broke they messed up my order there was no real management here at this location it needs alot of work 
-1,Lines are usually quite long and don t move very fast If you need a quick meal go across the street to Fresh Co 
-1,Not a great experience to be honest They messed up my coffee order and the bathrooms are pretty bad 
-1,I personally don t like fast food but McDonald s is a mainstay NYC has much more to offer than that as a food choice 
-1,Restaurant is aged Chairs mostly torn Ice Tea is as sweet as syrup 
-1,Wendys is better but this place satisfies the munchies Watch out for the dopeheads and crack fiends looking to score 
-1,It s a crack house that sells McDonald s Everyday All day But NYU is just a few licks away smh
-1,Not so safe but good worker s
-1,Its NY but come on you can t clean the restroom Also getting the key to use it is a hassle 
-1,Poor customer service Needs better management and SECURITY 
-1,Hotter than Central America in there Must have been over degrees that s Celsius 
-1,Dark dirty Homeless seating inside the restaurant with a foul smell
-1,The place was Filthy and the Seats are All Badly Torn This McDonald s is a DUMP FIX IT UP 
-1,good place to stop by if you need to pee
-1,I asked for a double quarter pounder with no pickles and guess what It had pickles on it 
-1,A place where you can eat buy drugs at the same time lol Not even in Brooklyn 
-1,Staff are bot too friendly they seem annoyed wven

-1,Poor
-1,Come on It s McDonald s
-1,Typical
-1,I wanted to get a McFlurry Unfortunately it was out of stock 
-1,A very degraded place and the staff is not friendly
-1,The order was simply forgotten We only received it after asking 
-1,Below average M cces especially in terms of cleanliness but also the friendliness of the staff You know that from Germany much more professional cleaner and above all friendlier I like McDonald s but we won t be going back here What was good there was enough space and on the upper floor you can also look
-1,Small food there is nowhere to sit the taste of the food is regular and they literally take you out and restrict the counters to eat when they are still taking orders at night 
-1,I rate it as good Nice physical space service too But unfortunately the place only had bathroom Men women children and the disabled toilet sink changer Oh you can imagine 
-1,One of the nastiest mac s I ve ever been to Small loud and very dirty read toilet tables floors brrrr 
-1,Very rarely go to the M ci But not recommended in the USA Small portions and actually too e
-1,Dirty place and long wait The food is different than in Italy
-1,Too bad the staff was about to fall asleep and therefore forgot a cheeseburger right away

-1,Ordered on the machine because the workers were too busy talking Pay by card at the machine and no receipt comes out I tell the worker I didn t get a receipt and he says don t worry we will bring it out I dutifully sit down with my table number with my family and wait I really wanted my receipt and as you can imagine this will be important later So we sit around for a while I go and ask for ketchup cream and sugar Get like ketchup packs for people s orders Ketchup poor I make my way back to my disappointed family and dole out one ketchup each More waiting finally I go up with my table number and ask about the order The same worker looks at me and says do you have a receipt My pocket version of Kafka bursts into flames and I can only laugh at the absurdity I finally get the attention of the manager who manages to pull my order from the void of the machine Why two stars Because when the g Food came the bread was good it tasted fresher than other recent McDonalds forays and from the time they pulled the order to when we got the food was pretty quick 
-1,All I needed was an iced tea it took over mins They wanted people to use the kiosk I guess I decided I just won t go back 
-1,I ordered milkshakes They just left one of them at their prep area almost min After minutes past I got one melted milkshake look like creamy milk that my kid refused to take it After left there I drove back and asked them to make a new one 
-1,Everytime we go through the drive through here something gets missed The caramel flavoring is missing from my latte today Fruit Fly is the OJ No syrup in the sprite Missing order items There is always something I realize it s a busy place but some attention to detail is needed 
-1,This might be one of my least enjoyable McDonald s locations Food orders are wrong bad parking slow service entitled employees I would go out of my way to NOT go here 
-1,First of all I can t understand why they had such a poor design with parking Parking is hard to get into and the shopping center has such a big parking lot It s such poor design Then they take a while for dine in It s faster if you order on the kiosk or app instead of waiting for them to take your order 
-1,Not very convenient if you just want to dine inside there s very little parking and difficult to get to other than that the food is the same 
-1,I had to go around the drive through times to get everything that I ordered Though people where usually very nice and apologetic 
-1,Very small McDonald s There is like tables inside and outside It gets crazy busy during lunchtime so expect your order to take a while or be messed up Also parking is limited 
-1,The only good thing McDonald s has is the Shamrock Shakes If they ever stop making these I will never go back I do wish they would put them back in the large drink cups It seems the prices keep getting higher and the cups are getting smaller and smaller Very sad 
-1,Yeah the food here is gross First and last time here The nuggets were brown not golden brown BROWN The parfaits looked really unappealing I m thinking they were frozen and then sat in the sun and baked and then were put back in the fridge Gross They had me park to wait for my order I stepped outside of my car to make a bottle for my baby The drive thru worker stuck her head out the window and yelled Your parfaits are ready Do you have feet You want me to walk
-1,Will probably update with a coveted three star review after I go eat some after work dinner SpaghettiOs and am not pissed Apparently my kid and the employees both counted two less McDoubles than I paid for and guess guess what seriously four french fries instead of five They stole my fries just like the last time I ordered fries for myself So dad doesn t get his burgers or fries cool Or maybe I can drive a couple miles through rush hour traffic and complain about a location I ve always had problems at to a person who doesn t care Think pizza night needs to be more often No wonder all these big fast food places are going out of business in Clairemont 
-1,There was a roach on the counter by the register The cashier and several other employees saw it They looked at me waiting for my reaction I will never eat there again since the last review stated there was a roach problem They obviously haven t done anything about it I will never eat there again And I m reporting them to the health department 
-1,I love McDonald s But always something wrong with my order This time I didn t get a cheeseburger Only the bun with cheese 
-1,Ordered mcnuggets with Hot Mustard sauce Gave me Honey mustard sauce And they flipping want an hr Can t even get your order right 
-1,Got two quarter pounders Both COLD So they do not make when ordered 
-1,The usual rubbery unhealthy mandatory fuel of the day

-1,Staff is extremely rude and unprofessional Except for the young year old woman at the register that got the toy I specifically asked for She was very kind The other two a young man and a lady that seemed like the manager had a nasty attitude and the manager spoke to the helpful cashier very rudely
-1,Staff were extremely rude Yelling at us to order at the kiosk even though we told them we only had cash 
-1,I was told that I had to buy something in order for my young child to use the restroom Not a problem but please speak to your customers with some level of respect Not yelling or sounding extremely annoyed 
-1,It was a little packed but cleared out quickly the upstairs was not crowded at all very surprised My gripe is that my server preparing my coffee dropped my lid on the floor and lookroceeded to place it on the coffee and hand it to me So I kindly but firmly asked Didn t you just dropped that on the floor She gave a look like Oh I did walked over to the garbage dumped it I should hve called the manager but she gave me no problem Just wondering if she has a habit with other items dropping giving it to customers 
-1,I came in at on a Sunday and no dam breakfast really The only thing I want at in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc muffin They had no pancakes I only drink coffee and have breakfast at McDonald s and they didn t have acceptable breakfast products 
-1,Poor quality and mediocre service 
-1,Lots of homeless dirty bathroom with long line 
-1,Cold burger without the customize order served minutes after I ve got the melting sundae Dirty mess upstairs 
-1,I honestly only went for a large French fry and to use the restroom Very clean great janitor Pay her more 
-1,The food was fresh and hot The service was quick and the restaurant was clean Maybe it s McDonald s policy but why do you have to ask for ketchup salt and pepper And then there s none of that in the seating area either I go upstairs find a seat take my food out of the bag and no condiments To get some I d have to pack my food up and go back downstairs for some frickin ketchup No other fast food place is like that 
-1,The food service is excellent if you are taking the food out it s great However if you plan to stay eat inside there are many homeless people inside the odors from the bathrooms dies not make it pleasant Must clean up the odors inside if they want me back
-1,Update it s so frustrating to eat here There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you order or eat your food In addition the place is still disorganized and dirty That s McDonald s in New York Management at this location is pretty lame 
-1,Stopped here to get a quick bite the place looks very dirty Homeless people in the entrance and inside The nd floor smelled like piss Just go here if you want to go to the bathroom or are really really hungry 
-1,this location has floors but usually only are accessible to customers wouldn t recommend eating here and strongly suggest taking your order to go as the crowds of tourists and locals make it hard to find a seat 
-1,The automated machine didn t print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number The problem was I had no reference to chek the order I spent almost dollars for kids and adults I walked blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces I ordered sauces and we got none It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders It s like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal It s so frustrating and plus it s like throwing oo out the window you really need to be better about training your workers 
-1,I am not that pleased with McD The ice cream is nice What I don t like about a lot fast food places is that the ongoing clean up process is sometimes flat out disgusting Who wants the crumbs from the table next to you in your food or getting dirty mop water inside your shoes because they are mopping under the same table your trying to finish your meal 
-1,The service is slow if the food taste good And anything more then the dollar menu the taste aint worth the price I think being extremely slow is a all McDonald s requirement tho 
-1,No tissues what so ever not clean lot of tourists from chinatown tour travel It is simply shame on McDonalds to do these rd class services confused and disconnected staff Felt like there was only one person working who looked like a team leader all employees making team leader work pity on him 
-1,I ve worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night snack A couple of years ago they modified the interior they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner Late at night they close the upstairs leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser The kiosks are annoying They ask if you want to take out or eat there If you select Eat In before you can pay for your order you re asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number Thing is there are absolutely no table markers you cannot complete your order without one unless you start over and select take out During the day perhaps eating in makes sense but late at night it s really only for take out 
-1,This place is more of a homeless shelter than a fast food restaurant There is an upstairs seating area which apparently only opens when the employees deem necessary There is literally nowhere to sit here Take out only 
-1,Food is not as great as it used to Fries too bland Burgers taste dry Only giving it stars because of their happy meal toys 
-1,System always seems to be down frequently Only accepts cash when their wifi is out 
-1,Small crowded with inefficient system with limited seating Messed up a simple order Had to wait to get napkins and ketchup since it s at front counter only 
-1,If it s busy you will wait ages Poor food at high prices Plenty of better places to eat nearby
-1,It s just convenient and cheap if you on the run
-1,No seats in any of the floors Too many people sleeping over the tables I just wanted to eat in peace 
-1,atendant was very nasty to me all because i asked her if they had ice i though there machine was broken because dhe was asking another customer was the soda cold enuff so i asked if they had ice and she replied very nasty 
-1,Food order took over mins Nuggets were dried out and old To top it all all no sauce or ketchup given They did refill my drink because I waited so long 
-1,Extremely slow due to the lack of staff expensive compare to those around the city Don t recommend 
-1,Needs more security Fight almost broke out between a homeless man and a patron 
-1,Obviously food is the same everywhere however this restaurant has a loitering problem from some of the local homeless The toilets in this one was also quite dirty 
-1,Always super pack Not worth the wait if you do come here They also had my breakfast mc muffin burnt I don t know what else I can say 
-1,Expensive crowded and slow service The worst combo for a FAST food place
-1,Two stars are given to the star Carla who made our visit experience acceptable due to her helpful behaviour and lovely personality Food was good but the place is not recommended for anybody especially tourists because it is alway
-1,One of the ladies was very rude to three other customers I get it I ve worked those types of jobs and I understand it s not easy to be in a good mood dealing with so many customers all day often the same problem many times and I get people have mood swings but this was more than just rude it was confrontational Not gonna give one star because she was
-1,Fast and friendly service but absolutely filthy No clean tables or chairs in the open areas Bags food and everything else under the sun on the floors Floors sticky Food in bathroom sinks Only here because it 
-1,This place is right next to New York penn station so expect a crowd and a long wait use the kios it s must faster The customers there tend to be loud and uninviting 
-1,Its a place to run in grab something quick to eat As far as sitting in there its not ok the ppl they allow in there are mostly homeless
-1,I took my children and their friends here for a treat after shopping We used ordering kiosk food was promptly given to us When we found seating it was right next to the McDonald s security Security cursed up a storm around my children with great vulgarity 
-1,Dont think i would go here on my own a lot of vagrants about Not very clean food was ok 
-1,The place is a mess and they didn t have breakfast They expect people to eat a McDouble with orange juice at am 
-1,There are better McDonald s places than this 
-1,McDonald s seems to be the meeting place for homeless and mentally ill people in NYC I don t know why 
-1,The food was ok but I have experienced better service They missed things The tables were in bad condition and the floor was not cleaned since ages 
-1,This is one of the busiest stores in the city You get everything here Definitely not a good place to dine in Lots of tourists and people constantly asking for money inside the restaurant Avoid if possible
-1,Looked like it could have done with some more staff Dude handing out the food just marked random ones as gone even though he didn t announce the numbers We had to go ask for ours It was just chilling there But it s McDonald s If you re going you re going to go regardless of the rating 
-1,To many homelessness are in this franchise it is quite disgusting
-1,A lot was out of stock and staff attitude is horrendously bad
-1,To crowded and not safe with homeless and drug addicts hanging out inside The good was not the same as other establishments Very disappointing with good and service Last time going there 
-1,Chances of being stuck by a hypodermic needle are pretty high at this location Restaurant is full with people you really wouldn t feel comfortable eating next too 
-1,The staff who work there have no manners whatsoever I go there everyday on my break and when it s time to pickup my order it s just a here you go I m always polite and always say thank you even though no one ever says anything back At this point I d rather talk to a robot than anyone who works there I d probably get better service 
-1,They need to keep the restaurant clean tables are dirty chairs are equally dirty you homeless people walk in there bugging us customers 
-1,This review is in parts st the dining area and bathroom and nd the behind the counter crew and food st this Mc Donald s seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO The place was VERY crowded NO social distancing NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in it did not feel or look clean or a safe environment good to spread germs and viruses alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and shoulder to shoulder in the seats people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving The bathroom was a horror show obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside was dirty nd the saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier the food expediter and the employees making the food they were all very fast pleasant thanked me and the food was hot fresh and very good Dining area and bathroom zero stars Behind the counter employees and food stars Combined and average stars
-1,McDonald s is fast food not because it s good but a quick cup of coffee ok Don t expect much as far as food The worst thing really is the ordering and waiting to get what you ordered Worse McDonald s is th Ave st Very bad staff I asked for a straw I had dropped mine no no no I said I ll pay for it never got the straw lol You will live eating the food get ready for cold food And nevermind an extra anything Shame it was not bad but now 
-1,Security was rude Has an emergency to use Restroom He said No unless u purchase something I explained I would get a coffee but I an Urgent need to twinkle He state not my problem I purchased a coffee Will Never patronize this business 
-1,Dirty sticky tables and floors Crowded Expect to wait a while for food ordered at kiosk and at the cashier No table service here Dark space Lots of transients though the guards do a good job of making sure people buy stuff 
-1,It s a McDonald s If you want you ve eaten at one you ve eaten at them all However this review is based solely on the location th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless problem and the restaurant is always swarmed with them If it were just that they were begging for change I could forgive it Unfortunately most of the people I ve seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying on They make me incredibly uneasy to the point where I m not comfortable eating here anymore More than once I ve seen fights break out Best to find another location 
-1,There is a hired male guard for the bathrooms to ensure only paying customers use it which seems overkill and made me as a customer uncomfortable The technology of coded locks satisfy this need for other businesses in the area Bigger concern is that a guarded bathroom was still incredibly filthy If you re paying someone to hang around the bathroom all day maybe also pay someone to hang around the bathroom and clean it There was a copious amount of a vomit like substance trailing out of one of the stalls that had been there for some time and one of the two stalls didn t lock Not cool 
-1,It was dirty homeless people hanging out inside asking for money I offered a person to buy a meal and was insulted I guess money was for Drugs or beer
-1,Ok for quick pick ups Not the best place to go for a semi decent eating The place was crowded the crowd a bit rough around the collar and the staff appeared rushed Have head better service same venue different later in the day 
-1,I had to give star because I ve been trying to call the phone number listed on the website multiple times and no one responded or go to voice mail with Verizon I had few missing items that I wanted to report The food came fast but I have had better food from McDonald s than from this location 
-1,Extremely busy when we visited at lunchtime with queues at most of the automated order points and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food which was good from the rather harassed looking staff Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum minutes to eat your meal this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the place I hesitate to use the word restaurant to describe this outlet As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock Diner which was really busy at breakfast time we had planned to try this McDonald s for breakfast but after today s experience we ll give it a skip 
-1,Very dirty place 
-1,This McDonalds restaurant was Ok Neither more or less compared to my expectations However I find it on a negative side note the constant stream of homeless people entering the restaurant causing somewhat of a commotion The service and the employees of the restaurant was helpful and fine 
-1,They botched an order Ordered spicy chicken sandwich and they gave me a dry one no condiment Compete with Chick fil A Yeah right can t even compete against popeyes
-1,For every good and helpful employee there s a bad and rude one to accompany them These employees seem to go out of their way to be as unhelpful and rude as possible And they ll regularly give you sauce packets that are sticky dirty and half destroyed It s honestly worth it to either go to the one in Penn Station or at nd street 
-1,This place is not very clean When I first walked in I heard yelling from a waitress saying and there were many insects in this 
-1,Hello I would have gave this McDonald s a better review but They have a person or the store manager on the floor telling people they have to sit and the back or leave these people are the homeless and IV drug users FYI THEY PAYED FOR THEIR FOOD 
-1,Sad to say the only thing good r the workers who work hard I only come for coffe but they serve u with a smile saddest part that this location Is filled with homeless people more homeless then customers sorry to say will I come bk yes cause I enjoy the coffee befir church 
-1,There was a constant beeping sound that none of the employees seem to care The tables were greasy with fries everywhere At least the food was made fast But I still recommend using another McDonald s 
-1,Food was good but my boyfriend and I not feeling good and my boyfriend been throwing up ever since last night when we order our food never eating here again
-1,No free refills on drinks much more expensive than other McDonald s The restaurant itself is in a sorry state of disrepair Broken seats tables with names carved into them grease splattered on the walls begs many questions about what goes on here Having recently eaten in other McDonald s all over the world this one has probably been the worst 
-1,The employees can t tell the difference between Diet Coke and Coca Cola worst of all I asked them for a second drink and they still got it wrong But they did do my Big Mac good so that why I give stars
-1,Just another place trying to automate to our detriment Ordered on machine requested eat in asked for a table ticket What the hell is a table ticket mashed in a number Received a to go order and my sandwich didn t have the lettuce tomatoes removed as I requested Can we go back to the days of just ordering at the counter from a human being 
-1,They didn t have enough employees to take your order and they didn t have enough workers to make the food Horrible customer service they need to have more people working over there 
-1,it s your typical McDonald s it s clean besides the crumbs on the tables but that s typical i didn t get any food just some coffee but it didn t taste right so i left it restrooms were also filthy when i went 
-1,missing part of kids meal plus less of following covid precussion disorganized to that extent gives opportunity of strangers to gather on order or pick up session 
-1,Dirty place slow service
-1,We had breakfast here a couple of times Always tons of homeless people around One guys was dancing like crazy Pretty entertaining 
-1,Loads of bums begging for food here and despite there being a security guard they allow it But on the bright side they got my order correct and all 
-1,I was just there this morning homeless people were in there sitting down the security guard on his radio and not paying attention to what s going on 
-1,Too much loitering from homeless people 
-1,No electrical outlets for customers in a fairly large restaurant They also got my order wrong I ordered an egg and cheese biscuit and got chicken which at least is more expensive than what I ordered even if it wasn t what I wanted Hash browns overpriced They make it look like you get two on the kiosk graphic to trick you 
-1,This place was quite dirty and very noisy We tried to order some food for dine in and it kept asking us table number There is no number on any table When I ask the staff they said they will ignore that Very confusing 
-1,I had not been here in a long time but that night the rest room was the most disgusting thing I ever seen The food was descent even though I was working my Postmates 
-1,There was like no ac The toilets were so gross The food was like normal McDonalds but it lacked a good atmosphere 
-1,Gave me the wrong burgers and seemed very dirty I did come again though and the food was correct and tasted like normal McDonald 
-1,Very slow for late night No communication with staff for efficiency At least one of the employees at register is willing to admit fault for delayed food
-1,Place is overrun with vagrance and lowlives Steph isn t any better this slow angry and miserable
-1,Ordered something and got something else I asked not to include the bacon but they added the Canadian Bacon and served me 
-1,The two times i went there for lunch my fries where stale and there is a bunch or ppl from some rehab near by that sits in there and trys to sell stuff or arguing with each other security is there but doesn t do a good enough job in my opinion
-1,Asked for sriracha sauce was confirmed that they had it Yet when we got to the hotel there was none in the bag Quite disappointed 
-1,Waste of my monwy
-1,Do you really need to be reading a review of McDonald s Customer service and McFlurry availability is hit or miss but the food is the same as any other McDonald s anywhere in the US except that one that still has pizza

-1,McChickens were expensive for some reason I don t like it 
-1,Not as clean or well organized as most McDonald s 
-1,Got my small order wrong 
-1,Place smells security staff is a joke
-1,Sometimes the closing hours are not reliable I cant tell you how many times I ve had to cancel an uber eats order for delivery because somewhere the order was accepted but this place was closed Disappointing to the customer who was looking forward to that late night wee hours of the morning food and infuriating to me because that s MY TIME wasted and money not going into MY pocket aka not getting paid for delivery On a personal note I ve had MANY upon MANY confrontations with the people who give me the food I ONLY drink REGULAR dr pepper and as an avid soda drinker since elementary school now I know the difference between regular and diet it seems like if you come here after a certain hour even though I ve asked for REGULAR DR PEPPER I always seem to get one that tastes like a diet one I have had them give me dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so I guess insistent that this was not regular dr pepper I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep which btw I m curious as to why I was charged for a large at this location when I m ALWAYS charged at the one on mathilda 
-1,Dining room closes at pm No self serve beverages Don t understand that at all The food is still good though just have to put some ketchup on a Big Mac 
-1,I don t know how you ve been called in When I came to in the morning it was people in there and they say was close How does a place advertise hr drive thru and only take cash after midnight I don t see how corporate agreed with this 
-1,Ended with a caramel frap all over my cup holder My burgers had MC sauce all over it like they dipped it into the sauce Just be careful I know is fast food but my car ended up super messy after my small meal 
-1,This store is so disorganized plenty of people working not all that busy yet took minutes to get food I m sure this is not the mcDonalds model 
-1,Absolutely done with this location I always seem to get the same woman at the drive thru I don t know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like it s my fault I don t know if she s special needs or something or there s a learning disability or if she s hard of hearing I don t get it And even lately when I hear it s her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it doesn t seem to help The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an order I m guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or something She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place
-1,The soda machine wasn t functioning so they had to get your drink from the one behind the counter the self order kiosks were all down ordering took a little bit longer due to one cashier 
-1,Overall looks like it s falling apart Ice cream machine broken half the time mcflurry machine couldn t mix in the Oreos roof is leaking 
-1,Consistently gets our orders wrong Including a time when we were complaining to the manager about constant errors and she was adamant that her team doesn t get orders wrong they handed us the wrong order Nothing wrong with the food but the staff needs better training 
-1,Friendly staff but fries were stale They even took some time to put together my order giving me the appearance that a fresh batch of fries were coming out of the fryer I was wrong they tasted like they were scraped off the floor Was here around pm last night 
-1,This location is honestly hit or miss usually employees here tend to be very impatient and rude very rarely would I see someone who actually has good customer service Also they would get my order wrong from time to time 
-1,We enjoyed the food But not the service only for the fact we waiting over min and this was pm My grandson was waiting on his aunt so she can walk with him and his mom dad for there night walk He has preschool in the morning And he has to be asleep by and in bed by So as for this gramas point of view An apologiey for the wait or here s a free of anything would have been taken in to consideration would have been excepted But no nothing from any employee just didn t make me feel McDonald s employee s did there job 
-1,Constantly getting the order wrong on several occasions poor attitude at pick up Worked fast food when I was a kid So easy to do it right and smile to the customer Unfortunately their manager was the one at pick up 
-1,Took minutes to order food while standing at the counter due to employees just chatting and ignoring me in plain virw Ordered a side salad and a yogurt parfait bother were less then half filled Overall not good but eventually got service
-1,Waited minutes for a simple hot fudge sundae seems like my order was not placed on their electronic queue Also pretty understaffed cashier also dropping fries into fryer and running around doing other tasks 
-1,food is ok just regular McDonald but the drive thru is insanely back late night mins wait time while there are just customers like how is this acceptable Soda machine ice cream machine or the cashier constantly broke down After mins when I finally able to get my food they told me no credit card like what why don t you tell me mins ago just left right away 
-1,You get what you pay for when going to any Mcdonald This is a busy location times out of there is lines and being a hr location they re ice cream machine seems to always be out of order hahah go figure I feel as if the food has become extremely salty at all McDonald s locations over the years not very good Found myself not finishing the food I had ordered And still hungry Go some where better If youve read this far you deserve it 
-1,Against the background of other burgers McDonald s is blown away it s a pity that some of the first guys are now lagging behind 
-1,If you find yourself scratching your ears while inside it might be due to very small bugs that most people can t see or don t think the bugs are bothering their ear My vision Better than both near and far Thanks
-1,Lady placing the orders is super nice The crew making the food complete morons Mixwd up order and put wrong condiments on wrong one Its like they just tossed it together Not tomention there is no way it ll pass wights and measurmentz I expect competence Which is clearly lacking here 
-1,Sorry but breakfast sandwich was not fresh It was hard bread and as slow as it was on a Sunday morning everything should of been made fresh sad I will not stop at this location again
-1,The clerk is not responsive she doesn t have any reaction when we order Silent for a while 
-1,Ordered a big mac for the first time in years Very disappointed because there was not enough thousand island dressing in my burger This will be the last time that I will be eating at McDonald s 
-1,Made me wait in the drive through overflow parking messed up half my order I should have checked but I wanted to leave by then 
-1,Under construction had drive through only and somehow didn t have water McDonald s makes the worst breakfast sandwiches but that s not particular to this location Only pro is open hours 
-1,What kind of McDonald s only open till p m for dining room
-1,Service good tables extremely dirty not enough employees to come out from back counter to even help wipe down
-1,I give stars out of five because the ice cream machine wasn t broken twice out of the last five times I came to get ice cream

-1,Devil
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Lack of customer service I wish McDonald s will invest in improving their hospitality more than spending alot of money in advertising 
-1,Went to order drive thru and not sure if it was the person was training or technical difficulties but the person who was taking the order could not understand or hear us After repeating ourselves several times I m guessing a manager took over but she had the NASTIEST attitude over the speakerphone I was clear on my order but I m guessing the workplace must ve been stressful for her to had taken my order the way she did It s McDonald 
-1,They got mostly all the orders wrong and also had a few customers including myself waiting more than minutes
-1,When this restaurant switched from Corporate to Franchise a few years ago I was really happy with the changes that were made the owner was seen there frequently the employees seemed happy to be working there and everything was running smoothly Now in the lines are terrible when taking your order they give you the total without asking if more items were needed seldomly the employees smile at you and you see that the employees are bothered by the customers I stopped visiting as often as I did because the service went downhill Today I visited only because a friend wanted some food for her son Unless serious changes are made I don t plan to visit again 
-1,This McDonalds has quickly gone downhill over the last year Service is slow on Friday evening or night plan to spend to mins in the drive thru and you better check your order before you leave Multiple times items have been missing from my order and just last week I only got of my pieces for the piece nugget I ordered If this is what we can look forward to as minimum wage continues to climb I won t be getting this for my kids much in the future and will just make chicken nuggets and fries at home 
-1,Mosr of the food was delivered after we were sent to the parking lot since it was big breakfasts and a mcgriddle with drinks Food was delivered within a few minutes but after waiting minutes we had to go back into the drive through Because they forgot our drinks After we went back they gave it and when we went home they forgot to give us straws and the extra hashbrown we ordered Food good but lacking service Very nice cashier lady but the food handler wasnt as nice 
-1,I usually DONT have a problem with McDonald s but tonight was different I was ordering something for my granddaughter then I wanted something for myself I was looking at the menu and the person who was taking my order was very impatient with me acting as if I was preventing her from going sometwh ere I said can you give me a minute please she replied under her breath that s all you had to say in the first place then when I went around to pay she disappeared and had someone else accept my payment Then I was handed my food with stares and nothing Said by the staff Needless to say I threw away the food Not about to play games with these little high school kids A company who cares about their reputation should try to train and manage their workers before hiring them Horrible service tonight 
-1,Uusually I like McDonald s but not today Ordered a crispy chicken deluxe meal Everything was cold especially the fries The one thing they usually don t mess up YUK 
-1,They used to be great but now the new managers are not trying to make customers happy I asked for fries during breakfast and was told no the new store manager said they can t comply I even told them I would wait The other staff here are great and friendly Sorry that your new managers are not following the corporate way
-1,The McDouble is terrible Very dry and very little ketchup and mustard on it Couldn t finish my first one Bread should taste soft and fresh Meat should be juicy And they through it together which makes a mess And hardly any onions on it Fries should be soft not hard and with plenty of salt on them ALL burgers should be juicy That s what makes a great burger 
-1,They were very slow I literally waited minutes on the drive thru It was about o clock at night I will not go to this one again Food was good but speed of service was horrible 
-1,Good was good but took minutes to get me an iced coffee 
-1,Horrible I hate to have to say that because I love Mc Donalds No toilet paper no hand soap in the restroom and just plain dirty When I told the manager she sent an employee to take care of it I saw that he went in with the items and came back out and continued wirking with thebsame glives he used in the restroom Really When I ordered they got the order wrong no napkins in both napkin holders and no salt In the dinning room most of the tables were dirty The worst part is that they were not busy Make it right please 
-1,Only one line was open and the food delivery people made it longer for the people ordering in line I waited mins in line I won t be doing that again 
-1,Order taker was a wee bit friendlier but person who gave me my food never saud a word Food luke warm but order was correct
-1,Drive through took minutes Food was cold Employees didn t say a word to me Pretty rough They got the order right so they get stars
-1,If you forget to put an item in a customers bag and they have to come back to reclaim that missing item it

-1,It wasn t too many customers at the restaurant and the French fries were cold

-1,Needed food late at night Felt awful the next day it s fast food I knew what to expect 
-1,bad food bad service but usually fast and lots of them around
-1,There s nothing special about McDonald s and most of the people working here act like they d rather be somewhere else
-1,It s realy bad when the register personnel cant count change that is done by the computer infront of there face 
-1,Order was wrong third McDonald without ice cream machines 
-1,Food is never fresh when I order 
-1,Do not ask A joke both the staff and food It s sad the quality had fallen so far
-1,I ordered based on a picture of the sandwich and did not have lettuce tomatoes etc 
-1,Service was slow girl on her phone 
-1,I realized that i got the wrong sandwiches when I got home it happened before customer service needs needs major improvement

-1,Cheap bugers
-1,Okay
-1,The attention was not good Neither the cashier nor the one who gave me the happy meal were kind I asked to change the toy because my son already had it and he responded in a bad way that there was no more 
-1,I have gone several times because it is the one that is closest to me and the truth is that they always give me the wrong order 
-1,I didn t like the service I did not like the service 
-1,Well the truth is that it has lost its quality and attention very few employees do not recommend it
-1,This was a quick stop for a bite to tide us over with my a couple of the kids with us We went thru the drive thru and even though it was slow business we were put off to wait a couple of minutes and the assistant that took the order was very crisp and short in his interaction He stated the price and told us to pay at the window where we were completely ignored for another several minutes while he I m assuming took the order for the people behind us When he finally took our payment and we moved forward to the window to receive our order only half of the order was correct and none of the condiments we requested were included That kept us trying to get it sorted As a supervisor and a manager I would hope review for management as well as employees could be considered in improving the atmosphere It will be a place I will think twice before visiting again If you plan on stopping in be prepared to take your time to make sure things are correct before leaving Be accountable for your time if you want your order correct 
-1,Service was slow cars went in the other lane before someone helped me in the drive through My mocha tasted more like plain coffee it had almost no flavor 
-1,It was bad enough when the dining room soda machine converted to the one nozzle machine but they also did it to the drive thru So now all their soda tastes nasty I thought McDonald s was supposed to have great tasting sodas not sodas that taste like suicides Not to mention their staff can t figure out basic orders and there s a chance your order is going to be wrong in some way Added with the homless going up to every person this spot used to be okay and nows it s more like the last resort 
-1,Usually busy but they get you through there pretty fast Watch out for the homeless people this McDonald 
-1,The only good thing about the location is it s cleanliness I ordered at the kiosk and took a table number for dine in They didnt being me my food I had to grab in from the counter Defeats the purpose of using table numbers Then the employee tried to hold my drink from me Had to tell him I had in fact ordered the drink he took away When I unwrapped the burger it was slanted a good How hard is it to stack a sandwich Staff don t 
-1,The tomato on the hamburger tasted FUNKY tonight really gross And chicken nuggets were stale and cold 
-1,Not open for pedestrians until am I had to queue up with my legs as if I were a car When I got to the screen noone answered me guess it only responds to humans in cars Helpful staff inside directed me to order this way but it didn t work If you don t have a car don t bother Still reeling from the embarrassment 
-1,A lot of stores are Really slow with their service What bothers me more is that no McDonald s has the same rules Is the lobby open today Or at this hour At this store Plus not all have a pickup Especially no pickup for Door Dash They make us go inside 
-1,Food was okay wasn 
-1,Food was cold nuggets not crispy or fully cooked so disappointed in the fry s let down 
-1,Lobby was closed with no sign or reason why no curbside spots and super long drive thru wait Attempts to call to see why lobby was closed but no one would answer the phone 
-1,The dining room is neglected every morning at this location So much so that the workers refuse to take orders at the register You have to use the keosks and if you want a sausage biscuit in a meal there is no way to order it with cheese in a meal Half the time the soda says it s out of stock unless you order a meal Floor is filthy in front of the soda machines Lids not stocked Garbages in dining room full to overflowing Kid came out and cleaned ALL the tables with the same cloth and no cleaning spray whatsoever 
-1,This location took really long to process orders and get their line moving I even had a mobile order and at about pm I had to take the drive through Took minutes They kept putting the wrong order on the screen at the ordering area Guy who talked to me was pretty rude when I tried to let him know what was going on Pretty sure it the gentleman in a tie that gave me my receipt 
-1,This is my first time eating at this location but probably might try it again for a better review but nothing about my meal was normal except for all the lettuce falling out of my big Mac nothing was excessively old but just seemed like they have us stuff that was about time to get thrown away none of my food was hot it was semi warm the nuggets weren t the greatest I don t waste food so I still ate it but I will give this location another shot to see if i can get better food for the price I a paid
-1,Took them forever to come to the register to take our order and then they let our bag of food sit there forever before they gave it to us Not happy with our services at all 
-1, minutes in the drive through again 
-1,No idea what time the lobby actually closes but pm is a bit early So headed to the drive through with everyone else and by the time I got my food it was already cold 
-1,These was the nd time I had this problem with the same McDonald s I was hoping that the first time just some kind of mistake So I fell for it twice And at the redickuless price they get like for like of a potato lb for that price in the store It will not be happening again No more fries from this place And all over cents worth of salt Lmao
-1,Super dirty and very slow It was at night and there was a small staff but I expected more from McDonald 
-1,We ve gone through three times now and it just seems like the person who s taking your order is n
-1,So as of late the past month or so they close the store randomly to save face and not overwhelm the low count of night staff they have It s in the morning no line and the kid working says it s going to take an hour When I knownfor a fact it takes about to min I had placed an order on the app using my free points Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now I m down from points to points AND STILL HUNGARY Yall lucky you get a star update I now have points O o yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have now SUX 
-1,Dine in experience was really not fun Went there to have a nice breakfast out and the cashier got into a screaming match with a customer and other customers got involved Bad vibes all around Food was fine as it s pretty much the same everywhere I drive twice as far to go to a different McDonald s even though dine in isn t even offered right now 
-1,This location is frequented alot but the other day was by far the worst experience I ve ever had at this location Not only was I completely disrespected and mocked My food was terrible almost like they KNEW I was coming Be careful going coming here 
-1,Really didn t care much for the area Homeless people in and outside of this restaurant Not that I dont like them but made me feel very uncomfortable eating meal with my small child The lady that took my order overcharged me The food tasted great Even put a Happy meal toy with my big Mac but I m not complaining everyone loves Olaf Restaurant has recently been remodeled and seemed fairly clean I probably won t go back But it was okay 
-1,We went through the drive thru and to start it took too long for anyone to come over the speaker and then they were quiet and hard to understand One of the things we ordered was a number two He was asked what size he wanted and what to drink as part of the order They didn t give us fries with our combo meal and when the manager FINALLY noticed me he gave us a medium fry not the large we ordered 
-1,Good service but I had told the waitress not to take my tray and that I had to go out to get a portable battery for my phone Upon doing so the security officer harassed me about smoking when I had not lit my smoke i then waited for his instructions when he started to speak it was in espaniol and he pointed toward the street I was somewhat confused and a bit worried about my LG Coffee and a set of gloves so my question is why Make your restaurant so user friendly and then harass it s patrons after a good dining experience 
-1,The old standby of a lb w cheese fries and a coke was a disappointment A warmed over hamburger patty that wasn t warm enough to melt the chee
-1,Frys were cool and soggy The double quarter pounder w cheese was slapped together were one beef paddy going one way and the other one going the other It was stuck that which made it hard to eat 
-1,This is more of a homeless shelter than a McDonald s
-1,First and last time to this McDonald s Had to stand around for mins aside from only people being there One employee caught an attitude when i asked for no pickles None of the burgers were wrapped right And they were so lazy about they job that at first they wouldn t even come to the register to take my order Kept staring at me expecting me to use their damn machine Customer service and being polite goes a long way ladies And learn how to wrap your food 
-1,Was forced to use the kiosk If you need to pay in cash you have to still use the kiosk then go the the cashier with your receipt and pay Check out takes a lot more time the food is not prepared any faster and the dining room or bathrooms aren t any cleaner So there is no advantage to the customer 
-1,McDonalds was fine the people I went with sucked But honestly this place is really sketch they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways you wouldn t have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds Half of them don t even buy anything they just stand around to heat up I presume waiting for the security to kick them out The other half stand in line and figure out that they can t buy anything at the front desk then leave Normally I wouldn t have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald s but they would randomly yell ask questions pan handle and just were being a general nuisance I understand that an establishment can t control who their costumers are so it s not exactly the MD s fault but still this Micky D s should be avoided at all costs for that reason I give them stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren t mentally broken by the end of the day I went at at night which probably affects my review but from the first impression I m not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant I was starving more than a communist in the gulag and I lost my ability to cook food myself Seriously don t go here it s horrible 
-1,The service was good Got through the driveway quickly with the right order but as I was leaving a homeless person tried running towards me screaming at my dog
-1,Picture a mcdonalds in a pretty rough area They have a security guard You need permission to go in the bathroom People are begging Seems dirty You can t expect it to be the best one The staff seem friendly for the most part and my food comes out fairly fast tastes decent I have noticed the buns are stale slightly around the edge at this location more than once I haven t had that happen at any others really I wonder why that is 
-1,Fast food fast service Low quality meals But you will probably already know that because it is a McDonald s fast food and not a whole foods Cafe organic foods The food price is above normal for what you are getting So the value is low in the area of food quality for the price What you are paying for is convenience They have a very fast drive thru 
-1,They get you in the drive thru I bought big breakfasts and made sure I got the syrup and forks The employee rolled her eyes because I seemingly didn 
-1,It was am when I went through the drive threw I ordered a sausage mcgriddle burritos hash browns Everything was hot except the mcgriddle It was completely cold and I had to warm it up in my microwave when I got home Then called the store and spoke with a manager about the situation 
-1,Not gonna lie my nuggets came kinda undercooked 
-1,Tell me how I end up with a double cheese burger whose patties resemble a sloppy joe My hamburger looked like they cleaned up the grill of all the pieces and threw them on a bun But I got it quickly and my coke and fries were good so I gave them stars 
-1,I m not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area It s pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road home gateway area I m not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion It s fast food Don t like the area Dine elsewhere 
-1,Its an average McDonalds And i would have rated it stars or higher But there is always A rude and sometimes and literate security guard who in morning doesn t speak any English the only English he does know is typed on his cellphone which he charmingly shows you if you don t buy something quick enough he says if you don t buy something get out then at night there s another security guard that isn t that much better he does speak English but again all he ever says is by something or leave
-1,The best thing about this visit was there were napkins and water so I could wipe down a table before eating It wasn t that busy and the food took a while to get order was wrong and the staff had an I don 
-1,Staff are jerks and are inconsiderate don t ever have the lobby open then gets mad when people that don t have a car go up to drive through
-1,They had one lane closed which is fine but the lane they had opened made everyone end up lining up in the street 
-1,Most people are very nice but the guy taking the money what a grump 
-1,Customer service is less than impressive Food quality was average Longer than normal wait for basic food order 
-1, Fast does not seem to be part of their vocabulary I don t know if they changed management or what but they screw up orders drive thru is slow most of their employees are rude It wasn t like this in the past 
-1,Fries tasted stale one of the ordered piece nugget only had they forgot Any of the two flavored sauces requested of the piece nuggets were in the order Just not a great day to go to McD s I guess 
-1,Had a crispy chicken sandwich and it had been sitting under the lamp so long that it wasn t very crispy McDonald s has really changed in the past year wasn t very happy 
-1,Hours are wring and they were closed when I went Usually they re alright bit not the best McDonald s 
-1,The security officer made me very uncomfortable He starred and starred My mom only got a sweet tea 
-1,Food was cold and tasteless Burger wasn t even warm enough to melt the thin layer of cheese 
-1,The cashier doesn t know too much about Mobile Order system causing a lot of time waisted Everything else is ok Except that some customers were frustrated about the new self ordering displays in the store Apparently not for all 
-1,It s McDonald s what do you expect 
-1,I sat in the drive thru for minutes just now because the manager on shift at the window was on their phone the whole time while they were severely understaffed 
-1,The lobby guy is friendly but coughing by people who are eating Staff were not friendly about no longer being able to take verbal orders and only using the kiosk 
-1,Very rude staff Forgot items of my food Contact their phone to express my issue Never got a response Extremely rude drive through person 
-1,Everyone was rude except for the manager that helped me at the end I think he was the manager how hard is it to get a iced coffee and ice cream in a cup 
-1,The employees were very rude and very unpleasant Need better people skills And better staff
-1,The only Mc that close s at pm and go s to driveway only 
-1,Their free WiFi unfortunately does not work properly at this location at this time That should probably be maintained pretty soon 
-1,Homeless people will ask for money in the parking lot The restroom has always had a dirty homeless guy washing himself or in the toilet stall EVERYTIME that I have used it 
-1,Why did you give me all the wrong orders 
-1,Ghetto dirty one employee in particular was extremely rude and clearly didn t want to be there The food came out quickly so there s that 
-1,The people was nice but they charged me for a cup of ice on a degree day
-1,Long wait and often they are only doing cash have waited in line for ten minutes to find out they are only doing cash a few times Last few times I stopped it was better 
-1,It s still just McDonald s 
-1,Always mess up the orders inside and drive up You always have to repeat your order times Awful 
-1,Typical of corporate America to say give us money in return will give you processed food and a clown to help you wash it down 
-1,While the food was fine and fast the place was a mess Not like normal fast food which is usually a little dirty It was incredibly dirty 
-1,The can be long lines in the drive thru I ve been approached by panhandlers here despite the presence of security officers 
-1,because the sausage mcmuffin is reasonably priced and it confuses me when ask for one I always get the overpriced awful one
-1,It took forever and not fresh Woman very mean to me
-1,Very slow drive thru People are lazy on preparing orders and take forever 
-1,The brief interaction with the cashier was almost non existent The large order of fries was more of a small order of fries 
-1,How do you mess up an egg mcmuffin Extremely dry buns I was checking for mold they were so dry 
-1,Does anyone work here We have to order ourselves I don 
-1,When I told the cashier my drink wasnt right he argued with me that that s how they make them there No way 
-1,Service food served at McDonald s Jesse really stood out but I do give this place into CA re Dee
-1,How the hell do you rate a Mickey Dee s Food the same in all of them some have decent or even great help so many have truly worthless turds all a management issue 
-1,Bathrooms are dirty and messy front lobby look good tables were wiped down and cleaned good hot piping food
-1,Slooooooooow After confirming the order three times they still got it wrong Also it s so freaking slow 
-1,Buttermilk chicken was dry Horrible meal And cashier was really rude 
-1,Prefer other locations Always security inside here and constant shady business going down outside 
-1,some homeless was there semi clean although great customer service
-1,Slow service full of dirty vulgar customers Wouldn t take my kids into this slum 
-1,The McDonald s app keeps malfunctioning It says you ve used the deal when you haven t 
-1,The food was cold and not what I ordered I did drive thru 
-1,They were fast but my fries and sandwich were cold 
-1,One snotty cashier to the next they need to teach friendly customer service
-1,About what you d expect from McDonald s but it seems the franchisee forgot to pay the heating bill Unprofessional and cold 
-1,Twice I ve tried to get ice cream or Mcflurry never have it
-1,I only go here for breakfast I don t like there regular menu items 
-1,Bad service cold food Never go there
-1,I had chicken mc nuggets They tasted y they had been sitting for awhile 
-1,Got harassed by a security guard minute I pulled made for an uncomfortable experience to many homeless people around
-1,After many years not eating junk food this time I found the big Mac was worse than long time ago I guess downsizing pickles and tomatoes is their answer to healthy foods and cutting costs But of course it filled me up 
-1,They stop serving breakfast at am As if people are lining up to get cheeseburgers at am 
-1,The employees are friendly Food comes out slow Too many homeless people inside beggin for money or food even though there are signs posted for minute limit stays I m not unsympathetic to the homeless however the staff at this location permit them to hang out 
-1,A little run down and doesn t have a full menu Really wanted some breakfast burritos but couldn t get any Food tasted fine but the employees were rude I think they assumed no one spoke Spanish but I do and I heard them making fun of customers and their accents and how they talk and what they were ordering 
-1,Drive thru service took mins
-1,Based on experience with mc donalds in europe this is rather sub par But it is ok gets the job done in feeding you 
-1,For one usually it s only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonald s food The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for dollars for bus fare When the bus stop is like to three blocks down the road I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money So for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find Food too they know where to go It s up to them to make that move Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald s need some updating I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonald s operates with the homeless so I guess they don t want to make it too comfortable I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged 
-1,I d say a below average McDonald s Very dirty and lots of homeless on weekends I ve been here No friendly workers here which is a McDonald s usual but you do generally get what you order somewhat quickly It is probably as cheap as you ll get in the area 
-1,Only two stars because their food sucks no matter which location you go to I was just trying to save some money and after six years of prison food I can eat just about anything 
-1,I took fried chicken This is the last time i take it Feels like years old Like i eat poison I likes the sunday ice cream 
-1,They re supposed to serve breakfast until am but they stop WAY before that Not cool 
-1,The environment wad tired I mean you feel tried when you enter there I won t come back here again 
-1,Large amount of calories for a low price There is a limit of minute maximum for seated eatting 
-1,Good taste like they don t change the oil
-1,Very slow and they forgot condiments we asked for 
-1,Very dirty place tables ground every where was dirty even not good food like the other branches 
-1,Poor service and always crowded But hey it s McDonald s what should we expect 
-1,Their coke taste bad as they used over chlorinated water for mixing 
-1,they don t have the full menu available 
-1,this place close soo early
-1,Ultimately I threw up so 
-1,A little rough around the edges 
-1,Bad customer service
-1,Food is too salty 
-1,Lot of areas to improve
-1,Super long lines
-1,not too much
-1,Wasn t clean
-1,What you expect
-1,Unhygienic 
-1,I couldn t recognize the order so I waited for minutes and verbally told them but they finally started making it but they brought something completely different from the order so it took even longer In the meantime other customers were asking for exchanges if they were different from the order 
-1,I will be brief I have never seen such a McDonald s The furniture probably has not changed since the opening of the first institution apparently the dress code does not apply here The counters are served by people in civilian clothes it is not clear who they are Okay I ordered food on the spot to eat he hands me a bag of food 
-1,Classic but cold
-1,As for the center of NY it is very ugly huge queues and terrible confusion when picking up meals I felt like at the train station and not in a restaurant
-1,This branch is not good Small and almost lousy Part of the food is new and the other is old In general this branch is not recommended
-1,unhealthy
-1,Poor 
-1,it s a McDonalds
-1,then the worst burger here in the US
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Bad
-1,Regular
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,This is my first ever star review I stopped in for a quick bit or so I thought I had no issue with the food or the face that there was a wait What I had an issue with was the one male working the counter was more interested in flirting with the girl with pink hair working the fry machine that he had customers waiting for him to stop talking to her just to get them items he left off their order At one time I was able to finally get the pink haired girls attention and I told her I was missing a coke She told him and he went on flirting I finally got his attention and told him I still needed my coke and he turned around and asked someone else to get it and went right back to his flirting I do not think that his actions or lack there of reflects the overall workers at this location but at the end of the day his actions are reflected in the review ratings that myself and others have given The food is great certain staff at this location not so much 
-1,Busy loud dirty disgusting The food was mediocre at best the restaurant was filthy employees were over stressed and understaffed so I really couldn t communicate with them I had an issue with a deal on the app and was not being allowed to use it appropriately but ended up having to pay a higher price anyway because I couldn t relate my issue to the manager without stalling line and making people wait longer 
-1,What happened McD Open up June 
-1,No self service slow service they messed orders up requested no bacon in a meal but they included it despite being shown on the affixed sticker however food was tasty albeit cold To add insult to injury the staff were relatively impolite
-1,I liked the chicken strips they were a little doughty though Don t like their artery clogging burgers and fries the coffee is better than over hyped up Starbucks 
-1,The security will kick you out if you don t finish your food in mins I was sooo shocked today when he came on me
-1,Not open hours as maps says If you don t have a car don t go here after pm Would be
-1,I had messed up a order and I called them to tell him that I want to cancel the order and get a refund but the first time I called no one answer the phone the second time I called it answer with a ring but no one talked and that happened to third time too I don t know what s going on The phone is probably broken but I still want my refund
-1,Didn t go inside this time wanted to use restroom they were closed And they ARE NOT open hours ever They dining room closes ridiculously early Drive thru isn t hours either Service usually isn t too good here I come here for Uber Eats a lot One night three times this same location Service was slow all three times 
-1,Ordered sandwiches and a lemonade in drive thru After minutes got sandwiches and a sprite which was a plain soda water 
-1,Don t eat here it s bad for you 
-1,Four Quarter Pounder hamburgers and a large fry McDonald s is expensive 
-1,This is place is always crowded with homeless ppl and their belongings The clerk taking your order is always impatient as if they have something way better to do than assist you and to top it off the dining hours end at pm so if you re not driving through drive thru tough luck save your money and go to another local McDonald s or the Farmer Boys less than a block away 
-1,In a high crime area Homeless begging for handouts at the drive thru and even robberies in the parking lot Drug paraphernalia litters the parking lot Security is very helpful considering they have no LAPD support 
-1,I work a couple blocks away and go here like three or more times a week Lately they have been letting me down I understand mistakes happen but if I come back the next day and say hey you charged me for a double quarter pounder and only gave me a regular quarter pounder maybe don t tell me yeah well if you don 
-1,I mean McDonald s is McDonald s as far as the food is concerned fast delicious and convenient The only problem with this particular McDonald s is the homeless population which of is no fault of McDonald s but you just have to be alert when going through the drive thru or dining in this location it can be quite dangerous at times the pan handlers can be very aggressive at times and confrontational So beware if you come to this location 
-1,I m from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite These are the things I noticed Active on site security inside the establishment I felt like I was being scrutinized I assume shady things go on here I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america There isn t really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well For the most part this is what I gathered from this place Taking into account that it was the first and only time I ve been there Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal If its any consolation I received my food hot and it was good 
-1,Drive thru service is always slow at this location I paid for my order at am and i know because i have my receipt but i got my food at am and this i know because i had to return a juice at am and i have a receipt for that as well minutes of wait aside from the extra time i had to wait in line to get to the order speaker and then to the paying window the only reason i waited is because i like to leave
-1,Homeless fighting in parking lot and harassing customers for money Dining area is messy and dirty It took minutes to get my order A worker was behind the counter eating ice cream cone dripping it all over the place and herself
-1,Very nice inside and clean But why do they allow homeless people just to sit and not purchase food Paying customers need to sit Not coming to this location again 
-1,There is a security guard cop standing around and he makes me feel unsafe for some reason A black bum was harrassing me and tell cop looked on It s not walker friendly as there is a gate around the outside At least it was clean on the inside 
-1,Food predictable it s McDonald s However I went through drive up and had vagrants panhandling at my window WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PAY A SECURITY GUARD STOOD BY AND SAID NOTHING and server said nothing I told them to get away from my window and one got loud and stupid Finally the server told them Wait over there or i won t serve you They moved If i was with my family i would have never opened my window then left without paying Since it was just me and my dog and i was hungry i put up with their nonsense 
-1,The slowest drive true that ever been I was in line for about and they were only cars ahead of me
-1,Worse designed for cistomers the confusion of where to stand no order or pick up area counters too hi in ice cream area tables are badly placed just looks messy with all bells beeps going off all day annoying to customers nerve wracking for wrks improved equipment is to be updated
-1,Although the food was fresh and I received plenty of ketchup Their soda fountain beverages were expired Every single one of them 
-1,Gave me the wrong cafe latte 
-1,Did the self order through the kiosk to avoid the line and still waited almost min for my food due to them having given out my order to someone else the first time 
-1,High prices And the food is sub par I don t ask for much but I do expect my food to be warm Do better Mc Donalds 
-1,Tables trashed floor dirty but service was good at counter Need more security in morning s excessive homeless very bad situation
-1,Needed to be cleaner I dining area place had to grab something before grabbing bus greyhound but food was hot and behind counter was ok 
-1,This McDonald s needs help as I was getting my breakfast there was a transient sitting down on the table not buying anything a man comes in wants to sit down and eat his food that he bought and the transit try to beat him up and the man s food was all over the floor this McDonald s needs help always the homeless people have dominated this place
-1,Tons of homeless I told them no politely but the persist until u snap the security guard does nothing the McDonald s is nice and clean and employee s are friendly
-1,Hate coming here I m going through the drive thru there s like multiple homeless people just knocking at your window
-1,The employees are awesome here but there are a lot a flies inside and alot of homeless in the parking lot 
-1,The food is the same as any McDonald s in the country however the manager does not care about customer satisfaction and should probably be working somewhere else 
-1,I m afraid this is one of the worst McD in the country it s location means that it will be dirty I have gone here only to get change for the bus Quite sad really 
-1,Have had issues with staff being unprofessional and rude at this location 
-1,Slow service soda tasted watered down and flat The eating area was not that clean food was still on tables 
-1,Everything is overpriced and the fountain for drinks is behind the counter AND they charge extra for mayonaisse
-1,Not good took long people walked up to drive thru window were serviced ahead of me 
-1,Never go to this place Very dirty and smells horrible A lot of homeless people I put stars only cause of cashier smiling 
-1,Too many homeless people out side and took them like mins just for some nuggets and a soda
-1,There is a young and very heavy set woman working the register that seemed to have slept through customer service training 
-1,This location isn t very clean and has a bad odor
-1,Wait time at am in drive thru is ridiculous 
-1,Restroom was out of service with so many customers you would think they would have it up and running
-1,They got a simple order completely wrong 
-1,homeless are very agressive and smoking pot demanding money at drive through 
-1,Horrible set up Employees replaced by Kiosk Just bad 
-1,In town from Dallas The Big Mac fu ed my stomach up Security guard was woke tho 
-1,Lot of homeless people that hang around even in broad daylight Was a little weird 
-1,Horroble service ill never go back again
-1,Rest Room was so duty and the chicken sandwich wasn t good to 
-1,One of two McDonald s stores in whole mid south Miami Beach area so you know what to expect It s dirty restroom has no water or soap to wash hands except if you use the handicap toilet which makes me wonder how often or ever the employees wash their hands before return back to work My husband got quite sick the following day because of the food We placed the order on the machine for dine in with table service but there was not a single table tent available well the store make it clear that you as a customer should better pickup your own food at the counter There s absolutely no service at all We will never ever go back to this McDonald s ever again 
-1,The problem I have with this location is that it s always dirty in the lobby area and bathroom Second hardly anyone speaks English there and my Spanish is horrible so it s hard ordering food sometimes The service is quick and food is usually hot and I had a problem once with the wrong order Check the lobby area and bathroom more frequently and use bilingual cashiers 
-1,Very busy location of course it s Miami Beach Typical Miami Beach Service attitude out of times when I have picked up an online order at this location I am the positive harmony seeking butterfly type of customer that walks in for pick up greets the human behind the counter with respect and a smile to than receive this nasty Miami B tch attitude that makes you regret not sticking to your fastfood free diet in an instant Is it really hard to hire friendly and customer oriented personnel There are so many seeking employment At least teach em to pretend to be nice to customers That includes Managers btw Further putting staff on the front counter who fairly understands English is just not fair to them and me the customer that just wants to pick up an order and leave fast Cause Fast Food you know Love the Sweet Tea def missed the lemon slices sadly not on their Menu at this Location Still lovin it 
-1,We went to this mcdonalds to grab a quick bite first of all the service was horrible they do not know what they are doing Second the food was cold Third the place looks dirty dirty tables and floors a lot of people coming by the table asking for money I will never go back to this mcdonalds
-1,So I ordered on the take out screen a coffee and sweet tea several times at this location Miami beach I like my sweet and not just some milky tasting drink So I select my sugar count and and creamer out all times they only got it correct once Here today and the girl didn t follow the instructions on her screen She just chose the amount she was going to put I watched her Then I went up to ask for extra packets and the girl act like she did not hear me at first then gave me packets So McDonald s either you guys are going to stop being tight with your condiments and put them out for your customers to grab if needed extra and if your employees refuse to follow directions
-1,Oooooo it was ghetto and they gave me the last of the fry batch they didn t have much available and it must 
-1,Before you can make it in McDonald s there s quite a few people asking for a handout Only self service kiosks No soap in the bathrooms How are the employees washing their hands Skip this one 
-1,Nasty This place has gross people inside They look homeless Inside and out There was a mentally ill woman yelling at staff when I visited I don t feel safe It s dirty They messed up my order They are in a rush Looks very busy here staff can t keep up They have given up 
-1,Rest room was out of order in such a popular location
-1,Experience world renowned burgers and fry 
-1,Its been a fixture on Washington Ave for years and it looks like it The clientele at McDonald s is never good but never quite as bad as beggars seated at doorways with signs pointed towards you If you like going to McDonald s in NYC at rush hour then this is the spot for you 
-1,This location had no happy meals for my year old higher prices than normal around the city and had drunk people sitting all throughout the restaurant and many asking me for money while with my son I feel bad as they looked homeless did help one guy out but most were intoxicated and making a mess not being polite at all They need to clean that up as it scared some kids and also makes you uncomfortable I ve had this Happen every visit to this location 
-1,The service is horrible I ordered on the kiosk then waited minutes in line to pay There was only one person on front of me Employees rude to customers At least the food was fresh Well as fresh as McDonald s can be 
-1,Terrible experience They were out of milk out of chocolate milk out of toys for the happy meals for the kids and out of juice which they had to replace with this awful tasting fountain juice It took about minutes to get three happy meals for the kids The washrooms were dirty no hand towels no toilet paper and the hands air dryers did not work The staff however were nice and very helpful the reason for my stars 
-1,I went at a m at tooks almost minutes to get mi meal Very poor attention Second time I went to this Mac and the situation is the same that years ago I think is t worst very dirty disorder everywhere completelly full bad mood in general That morning took me minutes to get my breakfast I promise will never come back 
-1,I ve upgraded my review to stars because in my drunken kindness I gave this place a second chance One of the only good employees seems like he got promoted to manager and this place seems to be visitable now I ll return again to see for sure because before it was definitely a terrible experience consistently 
-1,Not very good service Unique location but a lot of mismanagement Some of the crew do not acknowledge you they ll look at you and walk by while you re trying to get their attention but keep walking and check on the fries or smoothie machine then go do something else I ordered a mobile order which I never did hear my order number called until I inquired about it and the team leader or manager said I said mobile order but you never came up I was like there could ve been several mobile orders you weren t specific And theres constantly food and trash on the floor being picked up it reminds me of a GTA game 
-1,incredibly long wait cashier was stoned out of his mind wearing no mask and slurring his words and forgot half of our food smiling creepily and saying random things
-1,At night i ve been a very long queue to cashier Too many strange people want to orders services are very slow many misunderstanding speak english conversation
-1,Slowest McDonald s I ve ever experienced completely disorganized Plenty of employees around just nobody seems to kno
-1,Slow service even on take out didn t get everything I ordered and the food was below par Go to subway just down the street 
-1,At this particular McDonald s Washington st South Beach Miami The place is busy while the employees are moving around super slowly to get the orders prepared so the wait was a long for a McDonald s Otherwise no complaints
-1,Food was good service was god awful If you re selling hamburgers how can you have no ketchup or mayo packets Waited forever oh and they have the napkin police you can have napkins LOL The only reason why I m giving a second star is the food was good and hot 
-1,Service was absolutly shocking I have been there twice now Breakfast Lunch and I have been served but the same ignorant girl both times Even though it is only fast food I still expect the service to out shine everything else She needs a lesson in hospitality or go and find another job that is far away from dealing with a customer face to face The decor could do with up dating but its surroundings with the style of Miami Beach being art deco retro makes it fit in Food Breakfast was great quality was great had to ask for sugar and was given packets for some reason Lunch was poor no quality there cold fries and it was busy So that makes no sence Overall Poor Wont be going back there in a rush 
-1,MEH To th power only good thing is they re quick Service is subpar there s never a hospitality smile towards the people they re serving It feels like a grinder there they must have a high employee hire rate there no one gives that extra effort for the guests Thankfully there s a security guard working the dining area I know it s Lincoln road and there s been a homeless and late night problem since forever getting jacked for my fries will cause a huge problem 
-1,The food was good bit the service was awful The cashier got an attitude because I asked if my order was right Then on top of that the person handing out an order did the same thing because I asked for ketchup 
-1,The staff talk loudly they talk in their language The store trash was out of the container the whole hour I was there eating my food They re disrespectful to homeless people telling them to get the f out 
-1,The the drive thru is consistently much linstantly much lower than what s expected
-1,Really slow service Crazy long lines at in the morning Expect paying customers to be out numbered by homeless 
-1,Took long time to get food Food was cold when ordering on do it you self screen after you order everything you could not pay then had to get in line to pay AC was not working super hot inside 
-1,Only thing I liked was h running 
-1,Service is so so The bad some of the employees don t speak English And while I was here a confrontation between a black fat girl and an old bag on a wheelchair barking up a fight Heard the old lady call the black a gorilla 
-1,Disappointed wasted my time driving over here to find out that it s clearly NOT open hours JUST UPDATE YOUR HOURS ON GOOGLE ALREADY
-1,The place is nice but the table all ways is dirty is my time i have to clean the table at am they have bad attitudes all my family stop coming here
-1,Be careful they will only let you buy large meals at night time But serve medium not many notice because they re drunk
-1,The usual homeless pplz all over dnt feel sanitary to eat in but tak outs the norm 
-1,The place is a mess They take your order but when you pick it up it is different of your request The kiosks don t work There is a strange smell near the cashiers 
-1,Artisan Grilled Chicken was like rubber Could not chew it Payed bucks for a drink fries and tomato and lettuce sandwich basically 
-1,The food is good but the service and organization is a real mess Never go during rush hour 
-1,The food was allright but the staff was very unfriendly The need to learn how to greet people and smile 
-1,Bad quality bad service missed the notes Just go down the road to Five Guys 
-1,Most forgot they are working in customer service They talk to people as if they are doing them a favor instead of we re helping each other
-1,Legit almost just got robbed here would not suggest going at night even if your with the homies
-1,Pretty much every employee here is unhelpful and clearly unhappy My order is wrong every time 
-1,This location in Miami is horrible Ordered a Quarter Pounder and it came back twice under cooked Not friendly at all 
-1,Half the kiosk machine s where down and crowd control was missing Someone out front directing people and helping at the kiosks would have made a very different experience 
-1,Kiosks not working terrible restrooms missed articles in our article order You had one job McD 
-1,Fast service Good icecream But terrible smell and rude people 
-1,No veggie option that is a mess today
-1,Very disorganized I was given the wrong order then given an incomplete order after Only plus side to this McDonald s is the cheap food 
-1,The place in Google said open hs we went there by pm and it was closed
-1,Sooo dirty Used the bathroom after I ate and I felt like I needed a full shower afterwards 
-1,Ordered an apple pie at p and ate it at p only to relize it expired at p It was hard and cold 
-1,Order was wrong and waiting far too long for fast food on ly good thing was the milkshake
-1,Not very good lines some guy cussing thought he was first behind me a ways not so fun with a kid
-1,crowded dirty frantic fast service but your order may not be correct
-1,There is no free refill in this place But u can use mobile app for cheaper order 
-1,It was cool for a quick bite to eat
-1,I haven t been to a McDonald s in years but the prices are way up for a small breakfast fo
-1,Two stars just for the brand but let me be real here the staff needs training in this location Customer service not good Every time when I go there is a long wait I m talking about waiting over minutes or more to get your order and the bad thing is there is not a lot of customers to have this long wait Maybe they are always cooking everything from scratch I almost forgot to mention the funny part one day I was a hurry and could not stop my scooter so I went to the drive through and the lady told me on the speaker mamm please come inside we do not serve people on scooters on drive through I was so upset and could not find a place to lock my scooter and I gave up on the whole mac thing I just go there because my daughter likes to eat Md You can also find some homeless and junkies from the beach gathering inside to use restrooms Maybe just because is the beach area I suppose 
-1,I ve been here many times usually after midnight as I work late Recently the majority of the times I ve gone through the drive through they say that they re closed but when I ask what their hours are they say oh we re just closed for an hour this has happened to me at am last night am last week etc My issue is with the restaurant claiming to be open h even though it definitely isn t 
-1,Good place and good location But staff needs training Some workers are very very slow and you can tell that they are not familiar with the menu and point of sale machines It took them minutes to make my caramel macchiato Hopefully it will improve over time 
-1,This place is a total wreck most of the time This is an extremely busy location and I ve been going here for years as a customer and also as a delivery driver and it s astonishing that pandemic or not they still have the same issues They are never prepared to maintain the volume of business You often have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with the staff If you go at night particularly late night there s likely to be a long line in drive thru or inside They regularly claim their system is down and so are unable to accommodate you It s completely upsurd I don t understand how any establishment can think that this mode of operation is acceptable Other than that typical McDonald s 
-1,Customer service is horrible Food is disgusting and I love McDonald s but this one ain t it 
-1,I mean it s McDonald s right You know what to expect from the food which is both a plus and a minus However at this particular McDonald s right on Garnet in Pacific Beach they are undergoing Construction It seems like a complete redo the outside and some of the guest areas as well It s a mess and noisy but does not look like any RI modeling of the kitchen area is being done That makes me wonder why this has become the worst drive through around even before the construction Two cars in front of me still waited almost minutes Isn t that a lot from McDonald s Or foremost drive thrus these days it seems to be way too much time Now I m not just saying this because of today s visit this is been the case at this McDonald s now for the past couple of months Maybe it s short handed help but that would only be an excuse for once in awhile Anyway not a great experience but probably should be eating elsewhere anyway 
-1,I went for an ice cream cone and it s always sketchy A lot of times they don t have ice cream This time they were cleaning the machine in the middle of the day That s just stupid No ice cream cones or milkshakes or any other ice cream products McDonald s is known for this though Not just this one I don t eat their food because most of it sucks 
-1,Didn t take very long to get food but the person taking my order didn t speak a single word of English so she had to ask for help for everything I said She was being trained at the same time but couldn t even talk to me I understand Spanish is needed sometimes especially in Southern California but when it s busy and you re the only one working the register and the main language is English what are you going to do What s really going to happen is you re going to restrict what your customers are able to order I order the same thing every time I decide to come to McDonalds so I have no complaints about the food but this time it compelled me to write a review Was an uncomfortable situation today 
-1,As always the service is slow its a busy spot i get it Today the s were way past mine now i have to stand in line because i was told just a minute several times to find out about my order now i just want my money back not hungry anymore The Sup Did fix the problem though i dont know what was said i still only speak our official language minutes later out the door with an i appolagize update Avoid this place Didn t think it possible it could get slower dirtier or more Dangerous WOW My Bad 
-1,Even though they renovated this place a few months ago the homeless still call this place home I cant ever sit inside without hearing screaming or seeing someone passed out on the floor outside And the last few times i had to inquire about my order because they forgot about it If anything go through drive thru
-1,Staff were arguing amongst themselves whether who does what Managers were indifferent to employees and with customers Ordered two Happy Meals and a McFlurry and about customers after I ordered received their orders before me We waited around minutes or more The McFlurry was supposed to be the Stroopwafel and there was hardly any in it it was vanilla ice cream 
-1,It is a very clean and recently revamped McDonald s but beware taking your kids here as outside is well a cockroach infested wonderland full of PB s finest citizens That s all this Review gets Use the drive through you wouldn t want to catch Hep C on your way to wash your hands 
-1,Workers very nice but when we ordered at window as we drove off it was changed from Big Macs to quarter pounders I said something when I paid and he corrected it got to window and he handed me the bag they were quarter pounders Just took a long time and everything was wrong 
-1,Currently there is no reason to mantein the restroom closed These guys are taking advantage of the initial restrictions when the COVID pandemic started to avoid making the bathroom easier for costumers Other McDonald s in San Diego have already opened their bathrooms to the public and like most restaurants in SD 
-1,They messed up our order on two different occasions in the drive thru I do appreciate the enthusiasm they have I also just want my order right 
-1,Being this particular McDonald s is close to the beach one should come to expect that service would be more efficient Not this one Ray Kroc would be rolling in his grave if he saw this The cheese on my sausage McMuffin seems plastic also wait Luke warm coffee attitude to go with it There seems to be lots of friction between them and some some of the clients that come in there namely the homeless Not all but some of the staff was extremely rude to them refusing them service and treating them subhuman Shame on the manager I have been raised on Mc D
-1,Worst service ever at a McDonald s People waiting to order and the manager and crew wouldn t even look at us or tell us to wait After ordering I had to ask for my food they just left it there on top of the fryer 
-1,While using kiosk it made many selections for me I did not choose Had to delete many things from order got frustrated and just put it in It was too busy at the counter for the personnel to answer my question she informed me there were customers in front of me Being hungry and tired this was more frustrating than it should have been
-1,Very slow service beside expected business during the late night I would not recommend if you would like to get your food quickly during late night weekends It is as if they do not prepare for the late night rush 
-1,It s Mc Donald s what do you expect But it took three times to get a half cut tea And someone I was with once got a Happy meal there and they forgot to put the hamburger in So 
-1,It s Mcdonalds so you know what you gonna get for the most part The food here is a little below usual Mcdonalds You never get super fresh food The staff is typically disorganized and thee is usually people outside bumming money
-1,Waiting time is way to long Had to wait for about minutes for my food Thats not what i expect from this fast food chain 
-1,The fries were cold and hard the only bright spot was the drink
-1,It s not open hours anymore Closes about pm and reopens at am Place has gotten better since remodel but still has some issues like it always seems short staffed worthless bums still using drugs in the restroom and vagrants loitering outside 
-1,This location wasn t even packed when I pulled into the drive thru They forgot my fries and didn t put in barbeque sauce The food wasn t even warm after it was handed to me 
-1,The people that work here are very rude I am super polite to them and they are still rude
-1,It was in the middle of being renovated but the and food was worse than usual I would recommend staying away until renovations are done and then give them a chance

-1,Dirty no ice for drinks and a lot of food nat available 
-1,Only stop here if you have to 
-1,Stopped here at the Champlain location for a quick bite while on my way home The service was extremely slow The employee tasked with serving the food to customers walked out and took several minutes to return and upon return took several more minutes to serve the food The food was subpar as well My recommendation is to avoid
-1,The french fries were stale Edit dropped one more star it was noon only car in drive through ordered a double cheeseburger and fries Got to the window from there they sent me to there rd window where i sat for mins until i got my food The fries were half full and stale The cheeseburger was good though

-1,Give the wrong burger i asked for double qpounder and drive half mile and find I didn t get right sandwiches And drive delivery parts couldn t turn around after I kind when out my way to get a bit to eat But hop they put right one in the box the next time 
-1,On the rare occasion my family stops here the order ALWAYS gets screwed up More often than not it s the drive thru that screws up The kiosk is cool and the game on a table is fun but that in no way makes up for the lack of attention to orders My rare visits will become even more rare 
-1,The service was okay today and the staff was friendly I still had to pull up to wait for someone to bring out a simple order This location is routinely slow in processing drive thru orders I m talking minutes or more I wouldn t order anything there within an hour of closing I was once served an Egg McMuffin on a biscuit with a folded egg Some friends ordered McFlurries and each cup was less than half full like they rationed it out This is probably one of the most disappointing and poorly run locations You don t mind paying twice as much for a coffee at the Dunkin next door because the McDonald s is sooooo slow 
-1,Poor service it took over minutes for our food The workers were more concerned with the drive thru Nobody was working the front register or paying attention 
-1,No one waits on you EVERYONE wants to help you order from the buy here pay here kiosk I want to order my food pay cash and have someone there so I don t have to wait minutes for someone who has ignored the fact I have stood there min to show up and say May I help you Ya you could have been here minutes ago instead of standing in the corner with EVERYONE else running your mouth

-1,I came at am when they open and the doors were still locked I waited minutes because I saw someone walking around then called the store and she let me in She wasn t very friendly I gave her a good morning and a smile I don t remember if I got a good morning back but definitely didn t get anything close to a smile It is opening and the place is filthy from the floor to the tables to the restroom Whoever closed the night before didn t even wipe the tables so it s a bit understandable why she is irritated or whatever but lady I m not the one who left it like that so give me the smile you are paid to give me It s literally your job Plus smiling releases hormones that make you feel better Thanks 
-1,I work there and they drop food on the floor and still serve it to you people Half the time people don t even clean there hands often And use old grease at times or expired veggie produce Sorry guys They also treat workers like crap unless you kiss ass to them 
-1,I went to get four spicy mcChicken with a happy meal and two mcRibs combo I bought three drinks and they forgot to give me my happy meal and forgot the straws for my drinks The bread for the mcChickens were Nasty I understand is very busy but please pay more attention to the food and the service We pay to eat fresh food not nasty breads My friends and I went to the beach to have our meals and We couldn t enjoy our drinks because no straws PLEASE PUT MORE ATTENTION 
-1,This place needs a whole remodeling The burger was rubbery and the out side was beyond filthy My first tax paying J O B was McDonald s and I love giving positive feedback The only positive energy was the lady who handed me my food

-1,Very slow compared to other McDonald s Very cheap Ran out of coke no box for my happy meal different crack heads came up to me begging 
-1,Currently it s drive thru only and this is the second time that they forget items on my order This time I decided to return to get my full meal as ordered Unfortunately I found that this would cost me more in time and frustration I need a new franchise close to me 
-1,I considered stars for the food temperature hot but giving I waited mn in line I was not accepting anything less I m not sure of the cause but clearly this location needs a time assessment 
-1,Went for a pick up and took over minutes to get the food Three other customers got there after me and got their food before me 
-1,Fries were cold service ok the kiosk machine wasn t working right this place needs a change in it been like this for a long time Better service and fresher food

-1,This mcdonald is horrible Bad costumer service through drive thrue i do not recommend this mcdonald to anyone I hate this mcdonald and will always hate it Kay kay
-1,McDonald s is a place where it s hard to get what I want the way I want it without having to wait extra time The problem is that they put onions on everything 
-1,Ordered a meal the only thing that was bad was a fries there were hard felt like I was chewing on rocks never get fries here especially at night time
-1,Didn t have any more packs of peanuts for the sundaes Disappointing and this is at pm

-1,Scary parking lot Too many transients making deals Awesome food
-1,They had No Filet Fish today that what I came there for
-1,Bun was dry and fries seemed like they were sitting for a while
-1,They take their time a little too much 
-1,I always take long And always mess up on your orders 
-1,The place was filthy the ladies room was closed and I paid Starbucks prices at a crummy McDonald s 
-1,Only good thing is their coffee 
-1,Clean but too expensive for fast food 
-1,Waited in line for half an hour and it seemed like forever at the pick up window I asked if they were short staffed and she said they were waiting on the fries But when I got them they were cold She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting
-1,this McDonald s is more expensive than others in the area and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them 
-1,Frequently at this location someone is spewing toxic gases into the air violating local laws humane rights despite a security guard on site Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction such as because the US doesn t mint dollar bills and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike s g string If this location has take out hours dining room hours that should be posted on entry ways online Otherwise we patrons expect to sit down not be told the seating area is closed minutes prior to closing and minutes after opening MGMT should schedule site employee hours accordingly 
-1,Did not help me with a refund and took awhile to convince worker to take a look at kiosk to fix it 
-1,Honestly the worst McDonald s you d expect more from one by the beach and turns out to be the worst experience 
-1,Full of homeless people not like I m unaware of our global situation with homelessness but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don t do it at this one It doesn t have a drive thru so order ahead for pick up it does have self service ordering kiosk 
-1,SOOOO busy all I ordered was a drink and who knows who actually got it 
-1,This is hands down THE worst McDonald s ever The staff are rude racist and intentionally slow Don t waste your time There was a fistfight in the dining area and the men s room was full of weed smoke 
-1,Order was screwed up and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process SAD 
-1,Had to go and wipe my star review and turn it to a star since last year this whole place has turned into yet another slow Hispanic ran restaurant Used to have a diverse staff and be consistently speedy and hot now it takes mins with no one else in line to get some fries and nuggets while everyone is standing around twiddling their thumbs I ve been here at least times and every time I ve been here post COVID reopening it s been this same situation with the change of the whole employee personnel now it 
-1,It s a McDonald s that food is the same as every other McDonald s is decent didn t like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice
-1,The locations looks great and has of machines that allow you to order and pay but the service was horrible I ordered a sundae for my mom and after minutes of waiting I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered minutes prior I was given a refund without fuss before leaving The bad part to all of this was there were about people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly 
-1,The People Who Work There Were Very Rude Short In Response There Parking Garage Is Hazardous 
-1,They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat The problem is their smell We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed 
-1,Manager sucks I called her over for help and she ignored me Seating arrangements are disorganized The soda fountain machine is always dirty Hardly any ice When you press for a certain soda it runs water for a while Too many homeless people The only decent thing here is the food 
-1,I expect crowding because it s close to the beach The ice machine is always out they don t have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container and some of the employees have attitude The security guard tends to trip but it s not always the same guard Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers I only go there because of proximity

-1,No refills on soda pop They also saved money by not giving me my breakfast sausage Two stars though for having the lights on 
-1,Hotspot for the homeless Some people were very rude and bothering little kids This seems routine and manager didn t do anything to remove these people 
-1, stars because I had to dodge beggars and also because I got charged for a refill that must be a California thing but it s uncalled for

-1,Busy alot of people and very not clean in the sitting area
-1,They don t have combo items this place is so busy 
-1,I make this mistake every once in a while It is terrify at night with all the homeless 
-1,Very small place the coffee wasn t so good very crowded
-1,My experience visiting this place was not good It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service This McDonald s offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things I have to wait more then an hour and minutes for it The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem The staff attention was not good They were overwhelmed and didn t warning about the long waiting time In some cases one hour and a half This is considered the largest McDonald s in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city They should improve their service especially in the pizza area As a positive comment I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry with a large group and during busy times 
-1,Went on a Thursday so it wasn t overwhelmingly busy but still busy enough that there were lines to the kiosks people wandering to find a cash register employee Wait time was not bad Food came in probably mins We stayed downstairs to receive our trays at the counter I could see how there would be an issue if you went upstairs to sit waited for an employee to come find you The girl who brought our food was very very nice We received our pastas first even though we ordered the pizza first so I have a feeling it was just sauce pots sitting on warmers to dump quick dishes Not sure why other comments say their pasta took long Our pizza came out fine Really not worth the money but we went for the experience you get what you get in Orlando standard happy meal was and pasta meals were for a smallish portion of pasta with a McChicken thrown on top 
-1,We arrived at this large fast food chain store at pm and were surprised Bathrooms with no water taps and unused urinals and toilets ATM and soda machine out of use And to top it off dozens of unavailable products especially those made with ice cream 
-1,We were so excited to go here the kids were all excited and we traveled a few hours to get here and it wasn t that great They were out of a lot of food they had no desserts except for apple pie that all McDonald s offer They advertise chocolate cake and ice cream but when you go there the counter was shut down The big huge play area was shut down so no kids play area Also they had an arcade area that was fun but the big prize area where you cash in your t
-1,My kids wanted to check this McDonald s location largest McDonald s but they forgot to add slowest service ever in the fast food industry in their description We waited minutes for our order The staff was calm patient despite all of the unhappy people who were waited for almost an hour for their orders as well To whomever is running this location please get your staff the proper help that they need I 
-1,Very crowded It is hard to find a table Many seatings are removed for unknown reasons My order took literally minutes to be ready The sundaes were half melted If you just need some fast food there are a lot of choices in the area 
-1,Checked this off my list What I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds I actually have lived in Orlando for over years and today was the first time I went Upon reading some review I just realized it is the largest and an actual tourist attraction I took a toddler her to play and BOY what an experience Environment This is right off a busy intersection i Drive and sand lake The parking can get packed The building is huge You cannot miss it It is stories and the play area is quite big as well with an arcade inside There are stories you enter the play area on level You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster Upstairs was VERY HOT Like there was no AC and when you walk downstairs it was cool Niceness of the staff Barely had any interactions with the staff It was ok Dollar They also sell pizza and that was ok it starts at and every topping is at least Yes Probably not not really recommended 
-1,This McDonald s has everything cake pasta pizza and a fish tank and even a specialty breakfast We ordered waffles and French toast and ham and cheese sandwich You grab a because this place is super busy and sit down You can sit and watch the food being made We saw the food come out and sit and no one grab it employees and managers walk by Irene went up to a manager and asked how much longer and they said a few more minutes and no one still grabbed it Finally after minutes one of the same managers who had walked by it several times picked up the meals and tried to serve them to us We told them that we had watched everything 
-1,I think I had much higher expectations of this McDonald s because I was strongly suggested to visit I expected a foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure It wasn t They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order an extra step because no self service ones anywhere They had a separate dessert station and a walk up food counter to order or self serve kiosks to order from where they will serve if you eat in but not the soft drinks It is stories The nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge it isn t and a small arcade area very small The menu showed some items different from other McDonald s but of them showed OUT OF STOCK So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald s only it cost MUCH more All in all very unexciting and not what it should be for being the WORLD S LARGEST MCDONALD S 
-1,A different McDonald s experience worth trying We had a good time trying different menu items not found at any other McDonald s Definitely worth a visit if you re coming to Orlando Update Not the same as it used to be The selections are limited and not as international as it once was It lost it s uniqueness and it feels like it s just a regular busy McDonald s now Not recommended anymore 
-1,Don t waste your time or money We were excited to visit here with out of town guests straight from the airport Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand wait or snake through with trays of food Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute It is at least degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food after minutes i went down stairs and it was sitting there Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty No one to help with service or questions Lady upstairs spoke no English I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged After all that found one sandwich missing Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk Big mac was dry Worst one ever We won t be back 
-1,Today we had the opportunity to go to such a well known McDonald s the truth is that the place is very nice but in terms of the attention and organization it was terrible half of my order was missing and although I went to tell them that it was wrong they did not pay attention to me So many employees so they can t help me in my order My children were very excited to go to the play place but their air conditioning did not work and it was unbearably hot They should pay a little attention to those flaws Thank you
-1, Drive thru or in person their service is slow during most times of the day This is my second visit and I had the same experience 
-1,The first time we visited was at night and there was a group of male teenagers sitting outside the entrance to the building asking for money in threatening and rude manners It did not feel safe at all We did go back a couple of days later for breakfast The food was very good The omlets really hit the spot The service was good It is advertised as having over arcade games upstairs There is nowhere near that many and much of them are broken down and use your credits because there are no signs on them 
-1,I came to this McDonald s expecting at least some decent food and service judging by the fact they were just switching over to lunch but got met with some poor service from staff and mediocre quality coming from the food I asked one of the staff tall skinny lady with curly hair upfront if I could get my food cooked to order and she gave a slight nod as a response which I found extremely rude then moved over to the kitchen area so I decided to ask ANOTHER manager upfront and she was actually quite nice and went straight to telling the people in the kitchen and the moment she did the manager I had previously spoken to decided to turn around and say the slight remark You already told me I got it thanks which I found very rude coming from what you erd to my surprise yet not so surprised self I received very mildly warm food it tasted and was very obviously sitting there for longer than I would ve liked it didn t meet my simple request of 
-1,This McDonald s is unique in that they have a pasta and pizza bar and an arcade upstairs Everything was priced higher than at my neighborhood McDonald s I ordered a pasta plate and had a queasy stomac
-1,Food wasn t too bad for McDonald s standards Atmosphere despite a bit messy it s interesting since this is the biggest 
-1,Food was standard McDonald s They forgot our drinks for each person at the table and forgot our meal We had to go back multiple times to get stuff They were out of the drink flavors once we got our cups It 
-1,Largest McDonald s in the U S they are trying to doing so much and doing none of it well Four orders and three had missing items No salt on the room temperature 
-1,We went here on June We tried a little bit of everything Ordered a Philly cheesesteak pepperoni pizza kids meal big Mac meal and mcdoubles The wait was absolutely ridiculous and when they brought us the food it was ice cold We didn t complain because the lines were super long and nobody was around to help The one guy picked up my daughter s kids meal thought it was trash and I told him and he said he was sorry and walked off The arcade was just a mad house So busy and very dirty so was the restrooms We don t be going back that s for sure 
-1,We thought it would be cool to visit one of the largest McDonald s in the world We regretted it The chicken sandwich and pizza were all burnt a little too much The ice machines weren t working very well The place was a mess and loud for on a Sunday The arcade had a few money grabbers where it took your money but no game But the skeeball had a machine that let you play for free This place is just crazy and more expensive than my usual trip to McDonald s I don t need to try their pizza which isn t bad but not great either I would skip this or plan to come to try the pizza only as the price of pizza is fair 
-1,We were given the wrong meal the same meal more than times while employees argued that it wasn t our food and we ve been sitting here with our table number and corresponding receipt stating what we ordered for almost an hour still with no food The outside looks amazing but inside is complete chaos the coordination and way of operating a busy business to get people their correct orders in this type of area with high population needs improvement Update After mins we got our food Luke warm fries and the Sandwiches weren 
-1,I really wanted to looooove this Mc Donalds store since they are the biggest in the world But being this famous comes with a price overcrowded and short staff People were mad in the line asking for the food saying they ordered their meal minutes ago Hello minutes This is insane Very tourist location I just wish the manager would hire more people to work there so they can attend that much of people 
-1,Big disappointment They closed nd floor area at pm so didn t get to see upstairs Nuggets were smaller and drier than usual and they forgot half our order but they were nice about it Oh well can t expect much in this super touristy area 
-1,half of the stuff on the menu was unavailable the upstairs was closed granted i did visit around pm the janitor was moping the same spot for minutes and my burger patty was hard and a little burnt I would come back though cause it 
-1,Slowest service on planet Atleast cars left in last mins while I am waiting on drive thru If you can staffed appropriately and efficient folks can make thousands extra without doing anything extra Just process order with some speed and sense of urgency Very slow service I wonder if top management is aware of how slow is the food service in general at McDs It s been mins in drive thru still no luck There are only a few unique items on the menu and this i
-1,Too crowded wait hours in line for food just go to a regular McDonald s not worth the wait either Waste of time in line Arcade is also small and not worth it go to a bigger and better one 
-1,This place was cool However with Covid right now no one had control of anything There was not spaced out seating People were on top of each other None of the employees seemed to care that there was no social distancing I was expecting some type of Covid policy to be in place and there was for staff But they seemed to care less about the people who visited I will never be going back here again 
-1,Not a nice experience at all Kids were so excited about visiting this branch as its apparently been on You tube but omg Service is Very poor Staff seem to have been given a sentence of working in here The food quality is questionable as well Would not recomend at all
-1,Very nice staff but the reason I m writing this review with stars is because of the fish tank They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around nip at each other and other fish and sometimes even kill them They have one Bala shark which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST other Bala sharks Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone He is being nipped at his fins are torn and he gets about inches long full grown There are Plecos that also get about inches long full grown in there too I didn t know who was in charge I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of them I love the staff here I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and happy It anld be very happy in there Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish think about how big they will be full grown should have at least one gallon if not two gallons of water to swim around in The cichlids alone get anywhere between inches and I couldn t even count how many there is in there Bala sharks are schooling fish and get about inches and Plecos get about inches long and they get very wide as well V
-1,I thought I had experienced a few disorganized McDonald s before now This is a whole new level of bad management One hour wait time for a normal order plus a pizza The employees seem to all be very busy and there are plenty of them too This leads me to believe management are not equipped to handle a location this size and either needs training or needs 
-1,Absolutely horrible McDonald s the staff were rude and over worked They didn t help you in any way at all I waited minutes for a coffee and when I went to ask for the cup to pour my own I got snapped at 
-1, Hostess at the entrance had no desire to be there and wasn t shy about showing it same went for the cashier If you re used to Canadian prices expect to pay almost double that Crispy chicken had pickles on it and that s it no sauce or anything it also tasted like fish Do not recommend Beyond disappointing for being an attraction 
-1,Be ready for a min to hr wait for food For McDonald s food The line for cancelli ng orders was surprisingly long 
-1,Come on people this place is so dirty and gross Didn t try the pizza or pasta but felt like I waS touching every virus known to man My Big Mac was cold and no sauce I was standing there when it was put up 
-1,I was on my way to work in the morning I waited almost minutes just for service The young petite lady with some what red short straight hair and wearing a hat was rude impatient and basically I was bothering her But as I got to the window another sweet and friendly girl took my payment But as I got my food from the first rude girl she had this look on her face like leave already I am a morning person I m always nice to everyone even when I m treated disrespectful 
-1,Still waiting for a good McDonald 
-1,McDonald s is good comfort food when you need a bite Still wish they could improve on customer service and adding ketchup to the fries Disappointing only because it s a multi billion dollar corporation that can t get the simple things right 
-1,Cannot comprehend why McDonald s has employees posted in the drive thru lanes taking orders well out of view of the menus This just frustrates and delays customers for no reason If you are trying to be like Chick fil A you re facilities were not built to serve that operating model nor are your employees trained to work that way efficiently McDonald s used to be a place to dash into for a fast meal but it s faster to go and dine inside most any other restaurant at this point Food was up to standard and only reason I gave 
-1,This is the slowest McDonald s I ve ever experienced The staff is difficult to deal with and out of times our order is wrong Great location and clean facilities though 
-1,I have to do this cause I m upset with McDonald s as a former employee but also a business partner if you can call Doordash a business partner They don t pay enough so the employee turnover rate is high or they just don t show up they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged swamped and can t keep up I parked called told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru By the time I got to the window they hadn t even started the order It took minutes in total I lost money waiting on McDonald s Seriously reformat your business structure It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company Be nice to the employees it s not their fault I m not even sure it s the manager s fault but they have to tell their higher ups about this 
-1,It was ok but they didn t bag my happy meals and my nuggets and and no drink holder drinks and a shke so it all feel out in the car and the shake stained my seats but it happens right
-1,Very poor service While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee Upon entering the McDonald s the floors were extremely dirty but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush Then when I stepped up to the counter to order the menu screens were stuck on frozen advertisements Then I order Caramel Mocha Coffees After about min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager Come to find out the machine is on auto clean and it will be min before our coffee is ready Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees When I tell them that regular coffee is a cup and I was charged for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food That s nice and all but we did not want nor need any food I ask for just a refund at that point Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained While they were nice and tried to make it right I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food I dont often go to McDonald s but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression 
-1,The ice machine was out of ice had to wait several minutes for my breakfast due to all the online orders waiting in front of me service was really slow They obviously have a labor issue at this McDonald s not enough people working at this location 
-1,Normally I would rate this with a star but lately this location has been having a lot of staff coordination I just left today and I asked for pancakes with sausages and added bacon to it but they forgot to add the sausage which by the way normally comes with the order So I get to work to the surprise that I paid extra for something missing in my order The place and the food s fine but the coordination with the employees and the supervisors needs to improve a lot 
-1,Consistently inconsistent pre ordered thru the app No one in line in the drive thru took mins to get my order While I watched car after car after car go thru the line I finally called in and and asked the status AFTER Mins was advised the manager was getting it now Wait what It was beyond COLD of McDonald s down the drain And I ha
-1,Do y all close the dining room at pm or pm 
-1,Drive thru not hardly You might as well go in and wait Placed our order at finally came at There were cars ahead of us still waiting for their orders When you are in a hurry pass this one by At least they are consistent with their slowness The food wasn t even hot Tired of giving them chances 
-1,I used the app to order They don t make your food until you re actually there could ve just used the drive thru The food took over mins yes Then they almost forgot an item This McDonald s is consistently slow and almost always miss an item in the order but it s the closest one to where I live unfortunately 
-1,The continents glide across the earth faster than the line moves here Food was good at least
-1,I no longer will be going to this McDonalds on my commute from San Antonio to Kerrville once or twice a week I was there today and this is not the first time its happened I ordered one thing and receive something not even close to what I ordered I m always in a hurry so I forget to check the bag I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo and when I finally was able to open the bag and opened the container I had a bacon cheeseburger with onions on it not happy Also the tea is never the same its always way too sweet are not sweet at all I did call the manager this time because I was fed up he acted like he didn t even care I would not recommend this McDonalds 
-1,Super slow Trouble getting our order right even after repeating it back twice Order was right food that came out wasn t Once again with McDonald s if you must eat here the breakfast burritos are your best bet And Diet Coke McDonald s does Diet Coke right 
-1,Good like any other McDonalds in the world but this location like Chic fil a here in Abilene need to do something with the traffic jams they cause Franchise owner need to stop by and use the drive thru and feel the Pain 
-1,Food not always fresh Found a hair in my cheseburger and hardly ever any fresh sweet tea and staff not real friendly Just this location Ive been to other McDonald s and no problems 
-1,Fries not fresh and sandwich was weirdly falling apart Consistently not a great experience at this drive thru 
-1, stars instead of only because it could always be worse fries just warm Double quarter pounder with cheese just warm tending towards cold and the meat looked really dark like I would expect a black bean burger to look like disgusting The mayonnaise tasted slighty weird too I thought it might be miracle whip for a second Shares a fairly nasty restroom in the hallway between McDonald s and Exxon Over for this junk is terrible 
-1,When you go to McDonald s you are expecting fast and consistent food Not the case here My order came out minutes after I ordered and the sandwich was on the wrong bread 
-1,This is hands down the slowest McDonald s I have ever been to I m not talking one or two times they e been slow every single time I come here Glaciers move faster than this service 
-1,This is the third time i ask for unsweet tea and i get sweet tea They even repeat unsweet tea and have it on the screen as unsweet tea Folks aren t the brightest crayons in the box 
-1,They are very slow and also no dine inn They also forgot my damn sweet n sour
-1,Workers were not so pleasant to be around and my burger was not fresh I ve worked several fast food jobs I made sure freshness was top priority
-1,I m visiting from Florida and this is the second time try the drive thru and it has been extremely slow Only for an after school treat 
-1,The lady didn t do my order correctly an she got upset when I asked for the correct items
-1,Worst McDonald s experience Meat was old and 
-1,Too expensive for fast food that isnt very good Not always fresh 
-1,Ketchup dispenser empty days on a row napkin dispenser empty have to ask for napkins to get them Very very slow service inside 
-1,Always slow service from how it takes before someone takes your order to when you food comes out 
-1,Its McDonald s The nuggets were kinda old of course the ice cream machine was still broke Tea was kinda nasty 
-1,Still dont know how to skip on the pickles
-1,Much They always get my order wrong 
-1,IT is ALLWAYS hotter than any other arch we ve ever visited IN Surrounding town s 
-1,Only car in the drive thru and it took minutes for my food 
-1,Orders are always wrong double check 
-1,They need to improve on their listening skills 
-1,Slow service and as normal my order was wrong
-1,Poor quality food was served day visited
-1,Always take long by the drive thru
-1, 
-1,Got my order wrong twice
-1,It was just something to eat not a big fan
-1,Filthy bathrooms and a lot of questionable patrons 
-1,Earthworm burgers 
-1,Very slow service
-1,Too much SALT on food
-1,Ok
-1,Good
-1,Its slow food
-1,It s McDonald s 
-1,Coffee is good
-1,not healthy place
-1,Typical McDonald s 
-1,The staff seem so concerned with meeting their target goals they aren t paying any attention to the customers or the consistency or correctness of the orders Cashier wandered off to make a mocha but forgot to put the mocha in asked the manager if caramel went in a caramel macchiato The customers served ahead of me all had somethi
-1,Quite possibly the busiest McDonald s in the area Every time I go here the drive thru line is backed up out to the street and the parking lot is full If you like your fast food not particularly fast this is your place 
-1,Are use my mobile app this morning I waited to hear your associates voice he say go on with your order When I order it he didn t asked me if I wante
-1,This place has fallen off all kiosks were down this morning No one manning the register One drive thru working
-1,Every time I go there there are beggars who will ask you to buy them food to use your phone or to stick their hands and faces inside your car and ask for money I get that panhandling is legal in Oak Park but that doesn t give someone the right to harass you when you re getting food Please Oak Park government make panhandling illegal again most people who do this get in other people s faces and harass them and verbally abuse them God forbid one of these people pulls a knife or gun on a customer if they say no This location is always busy crowded with long wait times and half the time the food is cold 
-1,The quality of the food has changed the product entirety 
-1,Very slow service When I was waiting for my food two different customers came in with orders that were wrong I waited for over minutes just for McChicken sandwich 
-1,This location is iffy at times because they have a high turnover rate and always training someone new Hard to really have any continuity when u have all new workers every other week
-1,This used to be the best location for the freshest food but it clearly is not anymore My nuggets were over done and I had to pour my drink out twice because it either tasted like pure syrup or water and I had to settle for something I didn t want to drink Also how do you ask the customer what kind of sauce they want and STILL don t put it in the bag and got the nerve to catch an attitude when I ask you for it I won t be going back to this location 
-1,Went through the drive through and had poor customer service It was late at night pm though so I understand Also the wait was minutes for my order while others were churning through Lesson learned chicken tenders take time 
-1,It s not what it used to be There longer waits in line and the service isn t really all that great They re sometimes understaffed because that people are overworked or not paid enough However it does serve the local community and passerbuys So it is good for something 
-1,They never have fruit punch for kids and i can never get a carmel frappe im just going to start going to another one im disappointed everytime i come here
-1,Don t like fixing orders becomes very rude even the manager but does make thing I 
-1,Bad Manager who supervise this place because they care more about the Drive thur than the Customer inside they have one Register open with or people in line during peak hours after pm 
-1,We where in the drive throw line for over minutes That s just way too long
-1,Mc Donald s needs to give its name a goooooo This was terrible and dry The food was room temperature I have burgers fish sandwiches chicken sandwiches fries and drinks It was all terrible 
-1,Every time I purchase a large sweet tea it s unsweetened when I purchase the double quarter pound sandwich it s a single please correct or I will go some where else

-1,Poor quality of food and always have ppl begging at the window
-1,The dining area was dirty No straws or napkins available Crispy tenders were undercooked
-1,The dining area is always closed and the drive thru is very slow

-1,This place used to be quick and good food quality but it s the opposite now Just avoid this location if you can 
-1,Fast service but please don t confuse them they re on auto mode 
-1,I was in the first Lane drive thru and there were more cars on the second lane drive thru and they got their orders before I got my order placed and it was really bad the service Finally I was able to go through the lane place my order but they did not have it ready when I got up to the window so I had to wait about minutes in the parking lot for my order 
-1,Tried getting lunch while on break from work didn t actually get anything since dinning in was closed 
-1,The drive through was backed up it literally took about mins before I got up to the speaker After another mins of sitting in line I finally got my food My cup of tea had more ice than tea and my friends were extremely hard im not sure if they were sitting there and got dropped back in the grease or if they were just cooked way too long 
-1,Nicer now that it s been remodeled but I don t know why they got rid of the kid s play area I dined in today and my food took a long time The chicken in my salad was not good had tough pieces I ate half and threw the rest out The manager was super nice with exchanging my son s toy though 
-1,Went through drive thru ordered a quarter pounder meal with out cheese Was told only had can drinks Ok asked for a diet soda I was told that they only have can drinks and water Ok so I said water Then after I got my receipt and proceeded to next window I looked at the receipt and I was upcharged for the water What the heck So I asked the employee at the window wht was I uocharged cents for the water She said I don t know that s all we got I understand that the soda machines are down but to offer can drinks and water but uocharge and not told why or an employee to make the effort to explain or even care Terrible customer service Disappointed 
-1,This is one of the worst McD s around I ve only been there twice in maybe a year but both experiences were far less than stellar For starters the smell coming thru the window was awful On today s visit apparently the person in front of me claimed my order and the cashier didn t handle it well She kept yelling to the front that the lady paid for the wrong order less like she didn t notice and it took her about min to straighten it all out Skip this one and move on to the next one down the road 
-1,Lobby is closed often for seemingly unknown reasons 
-1,The times have gone there they are always super backed up I try to add something at the window I m paying and they tell me to go around and go through a big line for a single item after waiting for like mintues Also when I ask for a frappe they tell me they are not selling them right now just because they don t want to deal with more people waiting They need to get more people to work of they don t like to keep people waiting 
-1,I can t tell you how much I have the new kiosk system of ordering The employees couldn t care less if you have ordered or need to order and that goes for the managers also Everyone is only worried about what the lazy people in the drive through are ordering And to make matters worse if you want to pay with cash you get to order twice What a stupid idea why not just give me a place to do all the work myself like Fuddruckers 
-1,Line moved ridiculously slow tonight and food wasn t hot Not always the case but that was my experience tonight 
-1,Dirty dining room Beverage station needed to be wiped down Trash cans were overflowing Roaches Floors needed cleaning And no They were not too busy to clean We were their only customers other than the car at the drive thru and we saw at least employees 
-1,Nice place clean but got stars Always during lunch it gets packed and they have a way to order your food yourself now me being me I would help out bit when it s always asked in a rude way to order your meal back there I cannot accept They need more help there obviously Sorry McDonalds but needs to change there tactics on time management and other stuff aside from that a gentleman behind me did not get to order because he didnt place his order by himself but neither did i No bueno 
-1,I went at am and I understand not everyone is a morning person but geez she kept cutting me off and was very short with me and I was in a great mood but sadly her attitude got to me and ruined my morning Disappointed with morning staff or at least this lady individually 
-1,The burgers are constantly underdone but the manager is usually ok with exchanging them Originally they would try to explain its a temp cook and I had to tell them I can 
-1,Over cooked chicken over salted fries wrong drinks 
-1,Unpleasantly warm inside it s a warm day in December the men s bathroom was disgusting They couldn t sell me a hot fudge sundae because they were out of fudge On the positive side my hamburger met expectations 
-1,There was no one men the drive through i came back three times I love McDonald s I have been going there since i was very young I hope things change for the better at this location 
-1,Extremely slow service Staff unorganized and rude No gravy for mashed potatoes and they were old and cold macaroni overcooked Truly worst experience ever Not worth the e tra effort made to drive there and wait for fresh chicken 
-1,Service is slow sometimes they run out of drinks or can t make frappes 
-1,This McDonald s is like almost all others they not that good like most parents just went there because the kids wanted to play The play place is outdated its outside dirty and hot The food is like all McDonald s not that good but they do have two ipads on two tables with games 
-1,Park is very worn down with minimal area for kids Bathrooms are messy and unkempt However the food is still good and as expected just that it can be extremely dirty at points
-1,The workers were too busy standing and talking instead of coming to pick up the receipts from the customers to pay for their meal It was jus not right Had to wait almost an hour for the food It was very poor
-1,Great cooks here But this building is filthy Gross And the servers are always unhappy I have to drive out of my way to get a better experience for my money 
-1,Was looking at menu to see what I wanted and was told in loud voice I cannot order there use the kiosk I stated I was looking to see what I want then use kiosk I was then screamed at and told to go to the kiosk Nice customer service 
-1,Placed an order for pick up through the app They were Rude didn t give me a receipt and walked off when I asked for one 
-1,Only started coming to this McDs after the one on airport pissed me off And hard to believe but this one is even worse From customer service to cleanliness and also accuracy of orde 
-1,Door states the location is hours days this last month I get no answer on drive thru window am am am
-1,This particular day service was very slow Took eleven minutes to get my order and another customer asked for their money back 
-1,Frys where discusting brown and hard and awful tasting the hot and spices I got where good but the frys where horrible the line was long as well in the drive threw I woudnt recommend this place 
-1,They mess up my order alot and employee s act like its my fault That and after midnight they don t want to take your credit card Always claiming the system is down 
-1,The drive through cashier dumb as the dickens My order was wrong x so u be the judge Good luck

-1,My experience was ok They forgot little things in my order like a straw for iced tea and cream and sugar that i requested The wifi is not available like they stated when searching for wifi there is no mcdonals wifi instead it was a wired name like EBOS The connection did not allow for simple web browsing For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios This place is ok 
-1,Lines are SOOO long and extremely slow everytime I come here I don t know why the staff is so i
-1,High volume drive thru with heavy wait time This McDonald s can t handle amount of people that here If you want to wait a long time for the meal Then you came to the right palce
-1,The parking lot is one of the worst All the spots are way too narrow and cramped 
-1,Used the app to order but took minutes to get it to me at the counter That s way too long Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up The only thing going for this place is that it s Hours drive through And dont use the app relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs Update this place is torn down The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll Too bad cuz the hour drive thru was pretty convenient 
-1,Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long After bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food I m from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn t an option 
-1,I m not sure what s wrong with this location but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold Today I went through the drive thru and they had a rush there were about cars ahead of me So I m not sure how they can serve me cold food when they re constantly feeling orders Just extremely disappointed with this location I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder
-1,I ve given this location a few chances over the last two years and while the drive thru is fast the drinks taste wrong every time Something about their soda machine is just not working like other locations and hasn t been for a long time 
-1,There s a young man here that goes by the name of Muhammad He is extremely rude Not an exaggeration He has no concept whatsoever of customer service He pointed at me and started demanding me to walk over to him because of a mistake he made He 
-1,Every time I ve eaten there I ve never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table Always sticky and I ve had to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating I d think they would at least watch and take care of this situation Also very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast I ve asked if they could turn the AC down a bit but they said they couldn t Picking another MD now 
-1,The drive thru girl lied to me and the mgr stepped in to assist and the next time I went there I started out happy and said hi She did not answer wierdo Not cool to hold grudges I don t Every day is a new day and a chance to clean up messes She could fix it and apologize but she chooses to ack like a child 
-1,The drive through at this McDonald s has always been busy every time I ve gone It s honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry I ve been stuck in the drive thru line for over minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger Granted compared to In and Out that s nothing but this is McDonalds That aside the interior has always been pretty clean when I ve went inside If you go for breakfast on the weekends once again be prepared to wait They do take Apple Pay and Android pay The one time I used it the person behind the counter actually knew what it was So many places tell you they don t have it but just don t know what it is Another big plus is the drive through is hours 
-1,My brother and I tolerate it because it s close to us and it s open when no one else is But you get the loonies showing up there Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine Smells psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick 
-1,bad night went for a burger got trapped in the drive thru took almost ten min to get to the order screen only to find out their grill was down and they aren t cooking meat just nuggets trapped for another ten minutes for a total of almost twenty minutes with nothing to show for it things happen just put a damn sign up 
-1,Happy it 
-1,t s fast food they take like for an order and all the tables are dirty
-1,It takes forever to get breakfast here every time inside and out
-1,Cold nuggets Homeless people just walking around cars 
-1,It s a McDonald s so the food is very consistent Unfortunately the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it I ve been stuck in the parking lot for minutes with no way to get out 
-1,Gross bathrooms you know it s sketchy because they have security outside of it 
-1,Like stepping back into the s this place hasn t been updated for many decades by the looks of it Very old fashioned Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonald s branches I ve been to 
-1,Today restaurant is closed for renovation no date when will reopen but Google maps shows as open 
-1,The McDonald s I just went to was so filthy I didn t even eat there The parking lot was disgusting all around the outside of the building was really filthy Inside was better but not by that much

-1,Ordered via the kiosk Looks like management has posted a sign order via kiosk to get a free cookie My order didn t contain one I asked the associate she was puzzled They had to discuss with other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure Kiosk didn t give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback With modern tech they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy 
-1,This used to be a great store But recently they can t make frappe s Sad to not be able to fill 
-1,I hate McDonald s ever since they got rid of the breakfast bagel sandwiches lol was the only decent food left that I liked But decent fries and sundaes Only went cause my daughter asked for something 
-1,Usually come here because they have their stuff together Today was the exact opposite Hit the drive through for things and it took over minutes Had to wait in the parking lot for a big mac meal and a happy meal 
-1,I just ordered from door dash and this McDonald s sent my sons hotcakes with no butter or syrup They didnt even send jelly for the biscuits Just disappointed that s all Have a good day 
-1,I was not given a receipt otherwise I would ve complained privately I pulled into the drive thru around PM It was about a one or two minute wait before me and the woman in the second drive thru lane were answered Before that someone must have accidentally switched their headset on because all I heard was a lot of laughing and talking in the background When I pulled around to pay the woman at the first window wasn t able to locate my order for a moment But she triple checked to make sure that what she had was accurate So I paid received my change and she shut the window without another word or my receipt I pull up to the next window to get my food and drinks The girl at that window double checked which order was mine then handed me my food Even though I ordered a large Coke I was given a medium Coke but didn t see any use in complaining because I didn t want to hold her lane up When I pulled away I started eating my medium fry only to discover that the top fries were over salted and mushy I figured they must ve got mixed in with the fresh fries and kept eating I was wrong They only got worse They got mushier and more stale Like someone had reheated them in a microwave Absolutely disgusting I was too annoyed at that point to turn around and go all the way back I don t expect fries to be perfect all the time but I do expect not to get the fries that should ve been written off as waste The only reason that I m doing stars instead of is because the teens here are very nice They go above and beyond to make sure everything is okay Especially when I m inside using the kiosk But something about food quality and drive thru efficiency needs to be revamped This isn t the first time I ve received stale fries or had an order done incorrectly at this location I only come here because this is the only McDonald s on my route that doesn t put me out of the way but the lack of efficiency is seriously frustrating 
-1,I work around the corner from this particular location My coworkers were all excited to see the newly renovated location I usually don t get fast food but I really wanted a milkshake before work How do you redo the entire building but you still don t have any milkshakes I should ve taken the extra drive and gone to Chick fil A 
-1,burgers are like rubbers they taste awful i felt i am eating not fresh bread chicken was stretchy looks like it was made to last for ever 
-1,I got dinner at the drive through tonight and got orders of the bacon cheese fries when I got home and opened them there was a smallest amount of cheese and no bacon at all I also got an Oreo McFlurry and was handed it with the lid halfway off and it wasn t mixed when I asked if it was gonna her mixed she said not yet than finally took it back and mixed it all while looking very c
-1,the heavy set woman with the short cut quick weave with glasses is very rude and miserable looking i stood there waiting on the doordash order for min and she didnt ask how could she help me she didn t say anything she was skipping over the doordash order and just let me stand there then when the order was done she threw the bag
-1,Predictable Mediocre food Arrogant manager Incompetent staff They dropped part of my order did not charge me for it and woukd not restore it And got sauces wrong 
-1,Missing item from my order I call them tell them that one of my item is missing They offer me to come back to get it but I am miles away I am not coming back for it 
-1,This Mcds is average Ok service with ok food Nothing exceptional with this Mcds Only positive is they seem to be slightly faster than most but on a negative I ask for a type of salad dressing I usually get the wrong dressing Happened multiple times 
-1,First YOU have to place YOUR order on the kiosk Then wait almost minutes for your food because everyone is taking care of the drive thru Lol I went in trying to avoid the long line at the drive thru and ended up waiting longer 
-1,The food was okay The staff was very friendly But after I ordered at the counter I turned around to see a roach or beetle thing Then when I sat down to eat in the restaurant that had no air I saw a huge spider in the window and copious amounts of crumbs and food being carried around by ants 
-1,The drive through line was extremely slow and they had the second lane lit up but didn t wait on anyone I sat there waiting then finally gave up because when I went to go in the other lane I had to go ba k around the building and by the time I got there there were more cars ahead of me now 
-1,The staff on the drive thru don t have patience 
-1,As usual they dont listen to you when you make your order they just give you what they feel like at the time and they want per hr JOKE Maybe they robots will get it right 
-1,Bought fish filet sandwiches they were old cold and burned at the end of the sandwich it was horrible they should be a shame selling reheated microwave sandwiches
-1,The drive thru is a joke always messing up my order Best to go inside or avoid this mcdonalds altogether 
-1,Didn t eat dinner so I ord
-1,I don t have high expectations for McDonald s but this location is consistently disappointing Lots of mistakes on simple orders 
-1,This location can never get an order correct And they always seem to make me pull up and wait 
-1,Bought FOUR items here and they forgot one I am still confused as to how you can mess up on only four items After this visit I am really concerned about our nation s education system 
-1,Just a snack but no napkins not much fudge on Sunday
-1,Over priced disgusting food 
-1,No service at counter just kiosk if u know how use

-1,Perhaps the most poorly run McDonald s in Texas Visited on the weekend so naturally busier but the management attitude of employees and physical condition make this a location in my opinion the worst location we ve ever visited Trash everywhere see pic for example Trash on the floors tables parking lot Dirty tables Obviously tables get dirty So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitor s
-1,Frys were cold did not give me my large drink that was ordered and when I asked for my receipt people just walked around lost said forget it and left 
-1,Delivery complete joke Don t bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets I ordered spicy reg picked out at least different dipping sauces as required not to mention Desired by my kiddos We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard they didn t even give us straws either to go with our mango smoothies of them So Nuggets NO sauces AT ALL Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious 
-1,Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back
-1,The food is fine Service at the drive through is horrendous Unprofessional and unhelpful It s good that ther
-1,I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that that s the way its supposed to be I managed a McDonald s for many years I know better I still order their food regularly all over the country I know better The new manager has made things much better but standards still slip back to the old ways when he s not here 
-1,This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store there are always problems with food last time I went over there I had cold cheese burgers had to wait for my wife s food and came the wrong way If you want to eat bacon tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers there are just piece to none hahaha 
-1,Food was good Everything was right but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex which is really just for boys and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little yr old daughter She is obviously not into a avengers 
-1,They watered their parking lot with a poorly engineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freeze let everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke 
-1,This McDonalds sucks They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive thru but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds The management The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive thru timer because you will always have to pull up at this McD s Always Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times burger fry at pm pull up next to the other cars already there The one manager I ve had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order that I had to pull up and wait for more than minutes for no less and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash The best part He made me pull up to get the cash So again Mis managed terrible McDonalds It s a franchise for a reason this one just stinks 
-1,They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru Very slow Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number with nothing special added Seriously a quarter pounder takes extra time to make Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds 
-1,Urger buns taxted stale Fries were little more than broken potato sticks Absolutely terrible location 
-1,Girl taking orders in the drive through didn t listen very well Asked for hashbrowns it was never added to my order I said it times 
-1,The ladies restroom smell horrible Moldy and mildew y smell Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask 
-1,Charged me for someone else who already drove offs meal Then got my order wrong Spent minutes for fast food in the drive thru
-1,Order some food and they forgot to give me my Cheeseburgers I always check the bag before I leave I told them and the girl said it was in there I told her you want to come and check 
-1,The service at this McDonald s is always spotty this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general
-1,We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke we only get a drink there I m so we only go to for the play area and since it s broke my son has been very sad
-1,The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the McDonald s app 
-1,There worse Wet lettuce or dead Fries or nasty burnt dried up Sunday Sept Made attempt to call management but kept hanging up there phone This restaurant needs to shut down 
-1,How do you miss a patty on a big mac First time going there too 
-1,Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who gave me my food She was very kind and polite to me 
-1,Sat in the drive thru for about to min because they were very busy and still got very cold food Took the fries back Very disappointed 
-1,My wife watched the lady cleaning the bathroom take the mop bucket straight to the lobby where she mopped the floor then the bench where people sit Same water same mop same bucket disgusting 
-1,Only had nuggets in my box and the fries were way past shelf life 
-1,How can this place change staff so often and guaranteed to get tour order wrong
-1,Took minutes inside this morning for sausage bisquit Food was OK Warm 
-1, minutes between order and food then more for the rest of the order hash browns sausage muffin soda nothing extra or fancy
-1,They gave us wrong order had to wait mins r longer to get are right order
-1,They got our order wrong like three times I revisited Never again
-1,Indoor playground smells of mold The ceiling and ventilation have black mold 
-1,They are fast but they almost always screw up your order 
-1,Order taker was the most rude I have ever encountered anywhere 
-1,Always crowded but not because the service and food is good but because badly staffed Day and night 
-1,The music they play suck please get rid of it put some s s and s
-1,The fries were not cooked some were still ice cold inside

-1,The worst Attitudes Cold fries twice The clerk gave the cleaning guy my order in the middle of him sweeping the floor to bring to my car Unsanitary nd time the order was still wrong Food wasn t good at all Won t be going back 
-1,Incorrect hours I arrived at in the morning and was informed that they still closed
-1,I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night and waited for about minutes as they only took orders from the other lane I was not able to back up my car so I went forward to ask what was up When I got to the only window open they said they were only taking orders from one side I suggested they put up a sign and asked if could take my order at the window they said I would have to go through the drive thru again I am not going here anymore for this in addition to the times they got my order wrong 
-1,One of the worst with service I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup So I go inside I wait at pickup Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals So I try to be patient stood there for like min and never received my drink They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it Also they never sent the cashier who was struggling by herself no help 
-1,Fries soggy most of the time Soda gets bad constantly Gave me seltzer water instead of soda Sandwiches not bad except that they re dry sometimes Customer service anything else After every single request instead of would you care to try our new 
-1,No to all of that Always a long line The kids working the drive thru are always in a bad mood Orders get mixed up and the fries toddle between not being fresh to being freshly made in old oil I will stop there 
-1,Couldn t get a simple order correct so had to wait Asked specifically for something still forgot it and had to go in and ask again And food was subpar McDonald s standards so that saying something it was at least cleaner than most also at this point saying something
-1,The apple pies here were the worst It was like biting into a regular apple The only thing cooked was the outside The inside was cold and the apples were hard I went there to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat I won t be going back there I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for weeks This was their choice of reward for good behavior 
-1,With as much staff as was on hand there is no reason I should have waited longer than minutes but I did I was not happy with my order when I got it Nor was my body satisfied when it went down If you want to try this place knock yourself out 
-1,Sorry what i have to said but this place always is a mess Everytime you going to this restaurant have to wait a lot for your food just because the employes always been around they place of work talk like they are on the street in ocasion i hear said bad word when the costumer been inside the store honestly they need better cordination at the time of work 
-1,Order was wrong Paid for double hamburgers received single hamburgers Drive thru took forever despite being empty 
-1,The service is slow Order anything more complex than a cheeseburger and you are sent to the side to wait for your order On top of that your order is often wrong so always check 
-1,Service and the food here REALLY suck I ve been there a few times after work which is after midnight and always end up kicking myself in the ankle for doing so my order is NEVER complete NEVER chicken nuggets no sauce salad no dressing I ll pay for some cookies or apple pies and nothing not in the bag and to add insult to injury the food that does make it into the bag seems like its been sitting around for hours way to save a buck mickey dee s skip this place if you can trust me 
-1,The workers there are not professional i went in there to get my morning coffee and heard one of the girls using profanity and customes can over hear them then the cashier told me to give her a second and she went to the drive through window and start taking customers at the window while there was already someone there handling the drive through customers i stood at the cash register close to mins to place my order then on another occasion i placed my order on the mobile app the young lady made my ice coffee and left it by the machine another team member asked what i was waiting for i then told her my ice coffee the girl that made it told her im waiting on my ice coffee too mins later im still standing there without my coffee then the girl turned around and saw me standing there still then saw the coffee sitting there and eventually handed it to me and note i was the only customer left in the McDonalds other customers came in placed their order got their stuff and left a long time ago im suggesting more training for these individuals working at this location I have observed this for a while now and said nothing I turn my head everytime i pass there now if you re running late for work i suggest walking through the drive through you ll get your order more faster than going in 
-1,It s absurd how bad the service is here I wouldn t recommend going through the drive through They ll mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it again I d say just ignore this McDonald s entirely but if you do come to this location do yourself a favor Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food restaurant It ll be faster this way 
-1,Really bad service Food was cold And large fries wasn t even full Probably size of a medium Have to do better
-1,Too much waiting seems like the staffs don t know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain 
-1,Not Satisfied after buying Large orders of fries for and was given large containers SERIOUSLY HALF FULL looking like Small or Medium sized fries Very disappointed 
-1,It s my local McDonald s so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the nd drive thru lane But what s the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control Food wise things take a long time usually but it s your normal McDonald s type food except they don t salt their fries well 
-1,This McDonald s has always been bottom of the barrel as far back as I can remember and a sleek face lift doesn t change the fact that a visit to this McDonald s will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one so I ll compile a list Incorrect orders of the time Rude employees and managers Customers who are loud offensive and downright violent Poorly made slapped together food And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company P B S Parking Boot Service and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand cash in exchange for the boot removal It seems this McDonald s is doing everything to lose business They thrive off of convenient location alone Absolutely terrible experience 
-1,Every time I go I don t get what I ask and the some employee are mean
-1,More expensive long and I mean longgggggggghg wait times inside or out Oh and you 
-1,I went in to use the bathroon before i go buy some thing and i saw i had to be Buzz Inn so I went to the front to have me to be buzzed in and I was told no I had to buy something first and the funny thing is I m a diabetic and my sugar was high and I was in pain but I had to buy something first just to be let into the bathroom then when I was let into the bathroom it was so disgusting Know one clean the bathroom the toilet was filled with toilet paper and piss all over the rim of the toilet dry on u can see it and the manager that I m assuming she had like a Jamaican accent and gave me kind of a nasty attitude also i wouldnt recommend it to come here and i was visiting from upstate New York it was a long drive
-1,There are better McDonald locations then here Usually out of times they forget something you ordered 
-1,They never give you what you order and the food seems to be old and bad tasting 
-1,The food and workers are great It s the people outside begging that really You know 
-1,I just came and half of the Crew was hanging out side the counter they talk too loud and speak in a very bad way n words and Bi words is a shame the place is pretty but a has a poor crew 
-1,Rude people as cashiers slow service annoying employees I reccomend you go to Burger King the employees are much nicer and the food is overall better 
-1,Waited very long to place an mins ordered Terrible
-1,They are too slow even slower this time around Horrible service
-1,Service is slow waited almost minutes and they hadn t even started preparing our order 
-1,I bought two hamburgers it cost me 
-1,Food took forever to be prepared and they got the order wrong 
-1,Food precooked and dried out like always Commercial lies Nothingcooked when u order 
-1,People have attitude issues there not a good experience today
-1,I buy the salad there and put in the garbage very old salad and disgusting tasty
-1,Order a chocolate chip frape and after a minute wait they told me they didn t have any
-1,Bathrooms always dirty and my order ALWAYS wrong no matter what time of day 
-1,Not very pleasant
-1,They always always mess up my order
-1,The place is clean but the food is old
-1,I m from the area so I have been going here for years It s so so 
-1,Warm drink cold food

-1,Food was alright staff seemed too busy with their own pastimes rather then getting food and drinks out Saw one employee sweep four times in the same spot while three customers were waiting on drinks I d only recommend if it s your last option 
-1,Not too customer friendly a definite language barrier Ordered right when the lunch menu starts and the fries were mildly warm definitely not fresh 
-1,I went in and ordered at a kiosk to go I got a medium caramel frappe and a mcextreme bacon sandwich While waiting in line I heard the kitchen staff say there is no sauce for the extreme should we give it to them anyway With no intentions of me hearing When my order came out no one informed us there was no sauce didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it another sandwich or my money back I told them I heard them and they denied it then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich But she didnt I could hear them and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask I also noticed there was tomatoes instead of that i paid extra for same goes for the pickles I asked extra for I got a male employees attention and told him hey this isn t correct etc he hot an attitude rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member She intervened corrected my order The only one who helped She deserves a raise a reward Thank you P s the lobby is dirty Take some time to clean the tables
-1,For God s sakes please make the cookies fresh and warm when a customer orders them stop baking dozen ahead of time a
-1,Food getting bland service good atmosphere a bit outdated
-1,Missing large French Fries Wrong honey mustard instead of sweet and sour had to pay cents per sauce packet Very slow service The slow service might be that more time is put into closing the bag with tape than it takes to prepare the food The only reason they get any stars is because they were super polite 
-1,I ve been there twice My order was completely messed up both times The first time they offered to make the missing burger and make fresh fries I waited min before I said I want my food or my money now I got my burger and the same fries she took from me min ago I watched them screw up order after order while spending time playing and flirting Horrible place Needs real management Not management trying to get into their co workers pants 
-1,Very slooowww service Just about any time I show They send you to the waiting spot for minutes for chicken nuggets happy meals and chicken sandwich This happens often I will go to a different McDonald s 
-1,Same reason as before there was a rubberband in my food rapper and dirt on my bun
-1, Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order then she walked away with my credit card the large cup had black finger prints marks on it and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich The hashbrown was also greasy I ordered a bacon McGriddle w o cheese hash brown and a senior coffee She thanked me and stated my cost When it wasn t aligned with normal cost I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal That reduced the price very nicely but made me wonder why my server didn t at least offer to check the price to help me Then I decided if I m paying for my cheese I ll take it on the side When I got my order the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease The sandwich was messier sweet dough yuk and the hash brown soaked through the bag I know McDonald s serves fast food but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadn t eaten The experience reminded me they are not emergency food they are emergency room food 
-1,My food was fresh that s why the stars But customer service goes a long way And like an
-1,Dont think we got a reciept We like to come to this place after work because we got off around This hasn t just happened to say but we ordered Mcdoubles a breakfast sandwich and a mcchicken Instead of the Mcdoubles we got mcgriddles At this point with how many time my order has been wrong I should just have to stop to the side and check cuz I don t think we got a receipt
-1,Asked for no pickles and I got a warm chs burger with pickles yuck Nuggets were warm they forgot my sauce My drink was all wrong I think they are better at breakfast time Geeze
-1,Started at drive thru and started ordering food at first able to hear the lady but after I order my first thing I could not really hear her and then when I got my food it was wrong 
-1,Didn t get my order correct No inside seating I wish I could have tried their sausage gravy and biscuits but I am not taking that to go 
-1,I had to spend the weekend here Hate that as I might McDeath was doing fine with my ice coffees which I admit I am addicted Until Monday morning sigh when I got that McDeath manager who thinks they are in charge of making sure this multi billion dollar Corp gets its whether they are asking for it or not McDeath has a great app 
-1,The food was okay but the service was horrible I was even told to have a good night or anything like that They need better customer service
-1,I am very irritated right now The woman who took my order messed it up then shorted me on my order and I went back through to the rest of my order she proceeded to try and charge me again When I tried to call or talk to management I got fax noises This is ridiculous will not be coming back this McDonald s 
-1,This McDonalds is less than subpar They ve gotten most of my meals wrong have charged me extra on items before and a few times have just given me the wrong order I just stopped going here eventually and started going to another franchise down the 
-1,Third time in two weeks I wait through a long line only to find out that they are taking cash only Nobody can stand back at the entrance to the drive through to keep you from getting trapped in it This management team sucks 
-1,Decent food for mcdonalds but minutes to get your food unlike most mcdonalds 
-1,There burgers has gotten worse than ever but their fries are still good 
-1,Spent minutes inline at the drive through and the iced coffee was still very bland and unlike its normal taste
-1,What ever happened to fast service and hot food you get neither at this place
-1,You know those moments when you re looking for a way to kill massive amounts time Visit this place Seriously one visit and you ll understand 
-1,Very very slow Good coffee though But very slow service 
-1,They always seem to make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by being there 
-1, people ahead with orders and minutes of waiting for cold fries
-1,Fries were cold and wasn t cooked all the way
-1,I need to make it better quality service
-1,Pancakes we re cold and hard And computers were down
-1,Slow drive thru service

-1,This Mc Donald s was either short staff or very unorganized It took a while to get our order staff looked like they were overwhelmed and people kept going back to fix their order s 
-1,The automated kiosks are horrible This store is supposed to be fully automated but that s probably the reason why it just doesn t work McDonalds should really look into the process and solve it The workers are at the mercy of inferior technology I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the kiosks There are some that aren t working some that are working A customer instructs me not to use the one I m facing because it s broken Instead I use the one on the other side The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and cumbersome I have a coupon which I wanted to use I first add the item then scan the coupon VOILA double order Okay my bad for not understanding the system So now I have to remove the item I add another item and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says Is this all I want So I add some more things and finalize my order I try to check out but I have no way to edit my order to select to go Okay no big deal I ll just choose a table and VOILA ERROR Please see a cashier I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up front During this time I see and here about people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up really it s this automated system that doesn t work not the people McNuggets were okay They were warm but were on the verge of being dry Fries were okay looked like they were out for awhile and they didn t fill it to the top Soda this was good I felt bad for the workers here since it seems the biggest issue is problems with the kiosks and how orders are sent over to workers 
-1,This Macdonalds fell short on a good quality customer service their staff was very rude to us and a few other customers on our day of visit they messed up on our order and we ended up eating mins apart to my wife I was so disappointed Place was clean and you had to ask for a key to go into the restrooms we were in Vegas for vacations and we stayed at m ndalay so this was the closest one to us the rd day we wanted Macdonalds again and we decided to drive mins 
-1,The lady that served us un very unwelcoming grunt at me then at my wife when asked for the key to open toilet Hash brown was cold pancakes were hard and cold hot chocolate luke warm no lights were in outside the building altogether a very disappointing visit
-1,The staff was polite but absolutely everything else about the experience was awful My simple order had multiple mistakes and there seem to be an almost comical line of people who were missing hash browns from their orders The entire dining room was disgusting Not that it s their fault but there was a homeless man in front of the store that looked to be on the verge of vomiting and or dying This was like a m on a tuesday so I assumed they were short staffed if it was that dirty at that hour One of my two sandwiches and both of my hash browns once I visually got them were good 
-1,Waited about half an hour for my food Never been at such a slow McDonald 
-1,Most incompetent McDonald s I ve ever been to Service is incredibly slow Orders are constantly messed up Always out of ice cream Homeless girl inside asking all the patrons for money 
-1,Tried there mc latte coffee asked for iced one gave me hot and didn t want to replace it The coffee was too sweet and not good tasting overall probably wont take again mc coffee customer service in this location can get better 
-1,Went last evening Not hardly any business and was helped quickly SUPER friendly and great service which gets this two stars Hey it s McDonald s It wouldn t get above four stars even if it was perfect for a McDonald s meal lol Just not that good The issue was the OJ and apple fritters I don t love spending f
-1,Always an issue with the app here Entrance from the street is very dangerous for those of us that come from the back around the building from the side street then you cross in front of driveway to parking lot for other businesses on the way to drive thru This time as I m trying to pull up to the entrance of drive thru by the speaker a white truck came in and didn 
-1,Waited minutes in the drive thru and never made it to put my order in so I got the cars behind me to let me out of line 
-1, minutes to get cars out of the drive thru line When all the cars needed to be told was please pull around to expedite speed of service I left without eating because of time 
-1,The food was hot and fresh but i could not wash my hands The manager and crew was like the bathroom dirty so you cant use it yet no one went to clean it They offered some sanitizer wipes but you cant sanitize nothing thats not clean Had to eat my food with a paper towel 
-1,Shady area but food was okay Locks on the bathrooms so you have to get an employee to open for you Understandable I guess considering the location 
-1,Slowest mcdonalds I ve ever been to Been minutes and food still hasn t come 
-1,It was stressful watching everyone and everything The lady ordering a frappuccino and getting mad that they don t have frappuccinos seemed like a person I would never want to be friends with Felt sorry for the guy working the register for having to deal with that angry demanding bag But the food was good 
-1,Ok 
-1,What is it with McDonalds I made an a order the cashier made a mistake told me to drive around again I spoke to the Manager he waived the fee on the mix up of menu then we sat outside minutes in Las Vegas heat waiting for the food This place may be good for a walk in not drive through It s a simple order how are is it to get it right stars due to waiv
-1,Only eat here if you re desperate for some cheap fast food
-1,Very slow and poorly run store Has potential to be a great location with great profits But the management is horrid and help is not helpful and pretty much hasn t clue on what is going on Ordering takes for ever and food even longer 
-1,Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but I m absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant And filth is what I experienced at this McDonald s The staff who waited on us was nice accommodating and quick and the food adequate but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere Reason being there as no place to throw them away So I am advising you to avoid this McDonald s 
-1,They forgot my apple slices but still charged me we literally only ordered hashbrowns soft drinks and my apples it was not a hard order at all And I didn t notice till we got back to our hotel because you know you can t eat indoors or even outside 
-1,Quick service Burgers were barely hot A lot of aggressive homeless people in the area A woman approached my son and I while we were dining inside and asked Would you mind sharing some chicken Nope Never Again 
-1,I got a value meal hamburgers were very dry no condiments on the bun fries were not cooked all the way still frozen The Coca Cola was flat I don t expect gourmet just a little bit better quality 
-1,Not the best experience Manager was very rude and didn t rectify the situation which ultimately ended up being a customer service and quality of product issue She could have easily made it right but failed to do so I will no longer visit this McDonalds and I urge others to avoid it like the plague There are plenty of other fast food restaurants in the area that are worth visiting 
-1,After ordering my food and waiting for over minutes to get it Coffee was luke warm I went back to get fresh cup and I was handed a cup that had been sitting on the counter I told the young lady that it wasn t hot either and she said that it was the normal temperature of their coffee I finally got her to pour me a fresh hot cup This is definitely not the place to go to for fast food 
-1,Exactly what you d expect from a McDonald s minus the speed which is disappointing for fast food We went during what seemed to be rush hour but there was only a skeleton crew on and a single server We waited for minutes for our food and some of it came cold i dont even know how that happens Definitely not impressed by the service
-1,One of the worst MC D I have even been The place was not clean and the server messed up our order 
-1,One of the worst run McDonalds Chaos inside The order kiosks were only partially working long wait times and at least people had problems with their orders Needs a lot of attention 
-1,I m giving starts because we went there last week and was hard to order our food using the machine they have some are not working the security guy didn t help few workers only took us a while to wait for our food also you can t eat inside only outside and the tables they have outside doesn t have enough shade with those high temperatures and eat outside is not recommended I will recommend them if they are not allowing to eat inside a least shade the table outside 
-1,It was dirty and spills on the floor were still there after I ate The tables were dirty and the workers there were rude to other customers THEY WERE VERY RUDE 
-1,Came at am and the chicken nuggets tasted stale Had likely been sitting there for awhile I wouldn t have minded waiting longer for a fresh batch but perhaps they were expecting a rush and wanted to get rid of old food 
-1,One car in front of me they order big mac meal mins to get it Worst customer service ever
-1,Prices are too high just because they re on the Strip you don t have to double your prices personally I think it s ridiculous why rip everyone off just cuz you re on the Strip yeah I know rent is more expensive But you get so much more traffic so many more customers It goes hand in hand
-1,There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and stale Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and sad Will not be going back
-1,Very long wait for food coffee not made the usual way Cashier did his best to be courteous but without correct leadership that is best we will get 
-1,It was late at night so I was happy to see they we still open But the food was made terrible very sloppy and had a bad smell to it So I was unsatisfied

-1,Used the delivery to table option Waited for minutes When my food didn t come i walked up to the counter and ot had been sitting in the back for who knows how long Trash was over flowing they eventually locked the Mai Entry door with no sign up to slow down the in coming customers it was a busy night I m pretty sure this was a fire hazard 
-1,A busy hot mess with all the dessert drinks sold out service is slow as ever 
-1,SLOW service I ordered a spam egg over rice platter as soon as I arrived to the store and waited min It was delish tho 
-1,I rarely eat fast food but yes it was open late and we needed food Only one ordering computer open such a large restaurant limited to such a small area and no bathroom Really makes no sense Super slow service and the people that come here are super questionable One guy was so far gone I don t think he knew he was at McDonald 
-1,I can t believe they don t have public restroom There was security that can monitor or only allow customers with receipts Isn t it again health laws to not have a restroom 
-1,Very bad service The attitude of a female staff is terrible If you don 
-1,Its been awhile since I last eat at McDonald s and so I thought I d go in and have a Big Mac when I ordered she repeated one Big Mac minutes later they called my number it wasn t a Big Mac it was a crispy chicken so the manager came and recognized the problem then went away the cashier told me if I want my money back I would have to get back in that first line So now I m kinda hot then about minutes later the manager was waving a bag from the counter at me so I walk up and she said heres your Big Mac sir let me tell you that was the tastiest Big Mac I ve had in years 
-1,Seems like they always makes some mistakes when they get busy Rough way to complete there sandwiches Sauce was spilled out from box and made lots of mess Forgot to put bbq sauce for nuggets 
-1,Wow this is just a scary place lots of unwell homeless people Unkept dirty place Garbage bins overflowing

-1,Was very busy Skip the line by ordering online through the app Make sure take your order to go because the lobby is nasty 
-1,Extremely disapointing Skip the line didn t have pay working at time of ordering got lucky with the counter for it to be empty so we could pay right away Let me order something that wasn t available and didn t ask if something else was okay just changed it No unsweetened tee either but would let you order 
-1,One of the worst McDo I have visited Brown lettuce wet chicken Bad service At least the place is clean 
-1,Slowest fast food joint in the world Took minutes to get an egg McMuffin on a Wednesday at am 
-1,Your Covid rules are ridiculous In your effort to keep everyone safe you bunch everyone up either ordering or waiting for their food Your restaurant is plenty big to separate people out use it 
-1,I ran here to grab my wife some breakfast one morning We had grown tired of the spam sushi and other Hawaiian delicacies and wanted some good ol fast food breakfast I ordered the hot cake meal and a McGriddle I returned to the hotel to find they didn t give me syrup Upon returning they tried to charge me a quarter for the syrup they forgot 
-1,Transient folks were arguing in the store cussing and offending all who were there If u didnt have cents they would cuss at you I know the ladies that worked there felt helpless Need to have security protect paying customers 
-1,Limited menu expensive beach location without a public bathroom They make a huge deal about fresh pineapple with value meals but forgot to give it to us Very young and disorganized staff Not what I expected from a mcdonalds 
-1,This is by far the cheapest place to eat at Waikiki beach Unfortunately that also makes it a very attractive spot for all the drug addicts and homeless of the city While I generally don t mind homeless people eating next to a meth addict on a bad trip is not the most pleasant experience Not one star since you can get sick full for 
-1,Slow I only come here for Diet Coke and they take forever Wish that they would speed it up for drink only orders Always people loitering inside and homeless loitering outside 
-1,Over run by homeless people could use a security guard People are always taking cups out of the trash can and stealing soda from the fountains Ocean front seating is super nice though 
-1,Service here is real slow and they are not short handed and I only ordered drinks Order takers and person that seats you are the only high points to this McDonald s 
-1,Food was average Understaffed Too noisy 
-1,No matter what time of day you wwil see maybe people working in whole store Usually one or less gone for minutes cashier working the front Orders take excessive amount of time fullfill Thats if you even get what you ordered This is the slowest Macdonalds I have ever been to in my life 
-1,The food was good but the old lady taking orders was just straight up disrespectful I don t know who hurt her but it s like she takes her anger on customers Very impatient 
-1,Service is painfully slow even when it s not busy Staff have no sense of urgency Customers regularly ask for refund after waiting too long for their orders Expect to wait minutes just to get your order 
-1,My wife and I went to this McDonald s while on vacation in Waikii The person taking my order apparently did not understand English as she totally screwed up my order I dont ask much just be able to understand what I m saying Hawaii is still in America after all The food was as expected Ok at best But that our first and only trip there 
-1,Staff are super rude and uninterested unmotivated Got our order wrong a few times which is fine but it s all in the way you go about it Restaurant itself was clean enough which was good 
-1,Super busy which is understandable given the location Currently only open for take out Oh well 
-1,The busiest McDonald s I ve ever 
-1,Front desk was rude mins from order to get food Typical for Waikiki 
-1,Well it is typical McDonalds nothing more nothing less However the location run out of large size cup for soda only had medium or small which I really wanted the large one because I was planning to head to a beach to eat my lunch so I was already disappointed at this point but well things happens so I just let it go Then I pour sprite grabbed the burgers walked to the beach and finds out that my sprite didn t have any syrop so pure club soda that was so sad 
-1,Same ol McDonalds but without a daaaaamn toilet wth Busy as and on the dirty side but with heaps of foot traffic I understand Staff look like they try hard to maintain 
-1,There was a homeless guy in the restaurant that was being very vulgar It did not make for a pleasant meal The apple pies here are great 
-1,Food was ok staff was not very curtious and no public restrooms Would have been nice to be able to wash my hands before I picked up my burger 
-1,One of the lower end McDonalds I ve been too Food was just ok 
-1,Very long time waiting to make a order Very large queue
-1,Washroom was filthy likely due to the number of Street people that frequent the place Management not concerned Street people filling up on soda 
-1,Sign on table said cleaned and sanitized when the table had a brown coffee cup stain and other dirt Yuck 
-1,It s a homeless shelter at night They also dont have a bathroom to use or a place for customers to wash their hands 
-1,Not great I get it is in a busy area but service could have been better
-1,app doesn t work and theres always something wrong with my order every time i go there prices are no longer cheap either so now i go else where if possible
-1,Food and service were fine but it has no restrooms really of why I went in was to use the restroom
-1,I hate the kiosk 
-1,Disappointed All the other McDonald s give a refill on coffee Seemed this worker just didn t want to bother 
-1,Me and wife both have food poisoning from this McDonald s That s the only food we ate that day so it can t be anything else 
-1,Customer service is terrible quality of food mediocre waited minutes for our food 
-1,They are unprepared to handle a crowd long wait and food was cold 
-1,One worker wasn 
-1,If you give McDonald 
-1,Dear McDonald s Machines are not good replacements for employees Pretty dirty in there as well Less robots more janitors
-1,Staff was not friendly food was marginal and slow no bathroom 
-1,Long waiting period with lots of people They should have more staff at waikiki branch
-1,I ve stopped visiting this location due to HPD involvement it s complicated Civil rights violations
-1,It doesn t have bathrooms for customers only provides disposable wet towels
-1,Just tried to order and debit card machine not working Second time it s happened here in two weeks Really Poor management 
-1,No bathrooms and no smiles lucky my kids like the food
-1,Service was fine but why cold burgers and worse again cold fries 
-1,Didn t include pineapple with my deluxe breakfast even though it shows in the picture
-1,I only stopped there because my dog likes their chicken nuggets
-1,I ordered a hot latte and got lukewarm cold coffee
-1,Long lines but pretty fast service
-1,Food price is the most expensive Mcdonalds i ever been 
-1,It s McDonald s at least you get like an hour of free WiFi 
-1,Your typical McDonald s but you get to eat with homeless people 
-1,A disappointing visit We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register We waited over minutes for standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders While waiting we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it At that point I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn t realize it hadn t been served We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything They did make our order fresh once we asked for it which is why I gave more that star for the food We would not return to this location 
-1,Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in minutes actually tool close to minutes A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink That is ridiculous 
-1,Complicated kiosk ordering salty fries can order lightly salted decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite 
-1,No one to take your order it s all done on kiosks had to have my ice coffee remade because they couldn t get it right the first time
-1,A clean place with a good airco food is another story Bread of the burgers is dried out french fries were cold No do not go here if you want good food
-1,Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back
-1,Asked for a large water when they brought my order to my table And she never came back 
-1,I GIVE IT STARS because they were quick But on the other hand The fries were cold and the burgers were drenched with ketchup Told the gentleman to hold one moment and seconds later a girl came on Like give us a minute I normally don t write a review and I hate to leave a bad one But you would think because it s in front of oldtown it s hot and fresh Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal 
-1,Food was hot and order came as it was ordered However they had no pop It was okay would i go back sure 
-1,I don t
-1,They forgot my ice cream but I went back and got it The line is very long weekends so go during the week The curbside pickup is excellent I am appending my review this is the second time I ordered and they forgot an item This McDonald s is beyond busy 
-1,Every time I came during my two week visit I was asked to pull forward into the parking spots where the mobile ordering area is there was always cars pulled up waiting for food just so they can make their drive thru times better No one wants to pull forward for you to make your ratings look better Get it together 
-1,Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is 
-1,Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w combo purchase and when I went to check out it said Deal is unavailable wiped out the order forcing me to re enter everything and the deal code was now invalid I get that they are for participating locations but if you re not a participating location put up a sign or something so I don t waste my time The drink fountain was closed to keep the restaurant clean according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said We don t do refills here What Seriously Unlike every other McDonald s You re gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill Again if that is this location s policy fine But post a sign so that the expectation is set
-1,One of my favorite features of McDonald s for me is that I know what I can expect offerings flavors etc This is true for this particular restaurant however it seems that being soooo busy I guess excellent location makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers Running out of lettuce running out of many things are management logistics problems Bad attitude lack of courtesy well I guess that problem is on us the customers right The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still regardless of attitude and bad manners 
-1,Horrible Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich They gave it to me on a plain dry bun with nothing on it Just chicken bread 
-1,Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible see the picture Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month Took forever as well 
-1,Fries were good and hot I also got the crispy chicken sandwich It was hot but seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich I definitely will not get this sandwich again here I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonald s is a major gamble I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all Bland burnt dry etc take my advice don t get the c
-1,Our order was incorrect We ordered a Big Mac meal with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe When we said the coke was supposed to be large the worker Manager asked for the receipt which shows Big Mac Ml Lrg M Coke Then she said You have to ask for a large We did She didn t offer to correct their error When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink The fry was a large but they were cold The Big Mac was dry I forgot why we don t usually go to McDonald s Thank you for reminding me 
-1,We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America I placed a mobile order the cashier didn t know that after standing there for minutes he finally said mobile order I raised my hand and he slide me the bag Never
-1,Says hour drive through They re always closed shut down doing maintenance only cash systems are down or some other reasons why they can t serve the early risers They shouldn t post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers 
-1,Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving Bad move on our part Ordered a filet It was totally hard Not just the bread The fish was a hockey puck Very nasty Had to throw it out The fries were the back up thank goodness for those at least We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay 
-1,This is the only McDonald s I know that decid
-1,Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour If we weren t trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have They didn t give us any napkins and got our order wrong The cashier said it s always like this Absolutely not acceptable Especially for a McDonald s Did they forget what FAST food means 
-1,The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald s was because of my youngest daughter But what we experienced today put an end to it The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving customers in the drive thru area As you noticed there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case The associate instead of been polite talked to us in a not too pleasant tone I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience 
-1,I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work I got a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle the hash brown and a caramel frappe I ended up with food poisoning 
-1,I should never have to wait more than to minutes for fast food Waiting for over minutes in the line now and I still haven t gotten my food I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand This McDonalds sucks
-1,Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional If you are a tourist and don t know when it is cash only you don t get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude 
-1,Only go here because it s open late Food not always the same presentation or great tasting but it is McDonald s What do you expect You know when you go there what you re getting Cheap food poor customer service And maybe your order correct 
-1,All I had was a hot fudge sundae which was good The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda They legally should not have been open They were still running things as usual though 
-1,There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant s cold food and watered down drinks and if don t check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can t just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again Open up the lobby people
-1,This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald s just down the street for what is normally On top of it didn t even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald s
-1,So disappointed I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order which was Not working No one noticed we were having difficulty So frustrating Wont come here again for a long time 
-1,the drive thru line is super long and aside from that the people who should be taking your order there don t even answer when you get to the ordering station It took us about minutes to get a simple order and that was too long 
-1,Sat in drive thru for very long time to be told no fountain drinks no frappes no coffee and food was meh
-1,The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations making orders fast and reliable Notwithstanding the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff Ultimately the store next to McDonald gives customers a free gift if you bring your McDonald s receipt 
-1,Very busy Very dirty One cashier and at least people working Line was long the boy taking orders was moving at half the speed of smell I watched four groups walk out We should have followed 
-1,I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids and I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag I do not recommend the drive through 
-1,Horrible service General manager was in the store at the time Was punishing an employee in front of everybody Should ve been more professional and took him in the back area I waited minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh Don t recommend this location unless you can t get to a different location 
-1,Very busy mad customers long wait times for orders The staff is trying their best but can t keep up They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor 
-1,During the Daytime its alright but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES HR DINING ROOM So you re forced to drive through I didnt expect much but whatever 
-1,For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger Ordered mcdoubles with cheese and small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger and sadly I started with the fries And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt Never going back Would rather go to checkers across the street 
-1,The price is good using the McDonald s app with the dollar coke what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold They were absolutely been trashed Customer service was good this time 
-1,Ordered mcdouble bundle no ketchup light onions and extra mustard I got cheese and pickles The fries were terrible and my drink was fine 
-1,The never has the coke icee 
-1,Slowest most under staffed McDonald s I have ever been everyone honking on the drive trun people screaming they have been waiting forever very stressful environment 
-1,Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime I came here for days in total Normally I do not eat at McDonald s but this place is very close to where I m staying They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen Still gets my order wrong percent of time What Asks me what drink I want Then I just get the cup so why ask me One day I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom Locator and food is gone Takes me a while to get it sorted out forgets my drink again One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure Gets little sauce on my clothes not too bad but Jesus Christ One night lot of drinks do not work except for coke yuk few other things not worth mentioning They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink Clean 
-1,Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating Doors were locked Drive thru only Needed to sit at a table and eat Decided to eat elsewhere 
-1,Had a crispy chicken sandwich which was ok small case and fries which resembled a form of spaghetti I should of gone to Chick fil A 
-1,I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not They only gave me bbq sauces like who doesn t want ketchup The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again start because it was better then kfc 
-1,Didn t get anything to eat this time because they CLOSE THE LOBBY AT PM Didn t go through the drive thru cause I m on a motorcycle What kind of dingus closes half their store to customers in Old Town 
-1,Food cold and forgot items food was replaced so only star I m afraid
-1,EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING And i mean everytime I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few
-1,They need better customer service The people in the drive thru are so rude that I almost came out my professional skin Get it together McDonalds McDonalds close to go cart place
-1,We really can t understand how hard it can be to complete our order Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n it s so frustrating 
-1,It was terrible took forever Only giving stars because the McMuffin was good 
-1,I didn t get much sugar for my coffee all milk and day getting served my Burger not my Burger my sausage mcmuffin didn t give it to me in the morning They got me for some money not a pleasant place to go when you hungry you want your food
-1,Never once have I gotten my coffee done right Cream in sugar out I got cream in my bag It was cream in I got no sugar Crazy
-1,Not to thrilled with this one anymore used to love it when it was the world biggest McDonalds Now it s like the others except for a few items on the menu Plus they got rid of the life size Ronald McDonald 
-1,Burger was greasy and the fries tasted like the oil needed changed
-1,Food it s okay however the customer service is terrible The few times I visited here the staff was rude and unprofessional 
-1,Too long waiting lines to get a very bad customer service Food is ok 
-1,Having kiosks instead of human cashier really a bad idea not fan of it Taking my business to a different place were greetings and thank you is the most important thing 
-1,Food was very good but quite a lot was missing from the order when we got home 
-1,Let s put it this way you better check your bag of food before leave They can barely understand English let alone get your order right 
-1,Food is always wrong
-1,They can not get any order right My order took remakes and finally I had to go in to the restaurant after placing my original order in the drive thru 
-1,I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food 
-1,Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds I ve been to for service
-1,Usally the location I visit is on the money both with over allservice and cleanses how ever this particular day the place was a total mess and service was horrible when it should not have been because it wasn t busy 
-1,Ordered double fish fillet sandwiches and got double and single Order must be checked and double checked for Togo I m not coming back to change the order after few miles 
-1,They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins
-1,The good thing is that is open They do not have enough personnel Food was just okay help us survive till the next morning 
-1,Standard food Fast service Cash only at night More expensive than other McDs 
-1,The only thing worse than the service was the food My wife s Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray 
-1,This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said yes horrible place will not recommend it
-1,Curbside is a joke Waited for mins should just go through the drive thru 
-1,Always a long wait today it took min in drive through most times around min but like their ice tea so but up with it
-1,Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they weren t remorseful for messing up my order at all
-1,FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE The service slow and unfriendly 
-1,Dirty unkind too long waiting time too high work load with minimum of employees
-1,Waited on line for mins just to place the order 
-1,Horrible service Looked like they didn 
-1,Stay away from this McDonald s seriously Worst service I 
-1,The people working here are not friendly Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total 
-1,Somehow they forgot to give us our order no big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize
-1,Food was cold Service could of been better
-1,Weird credit card layout tea was hot of a cup filled up and bland would skip this McDonald 
-1,Waited minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken
-1,I was there to separate times one time I paid over more than the second time and got the exact same thing
-1,Had a weird terrible unusual experience Went tonight about pm Only cars in front of me Ordered using my mobile app which I love it Ordered a mc chicken and guess what It came with NO CHICkEN And enough mayo to make two more Enjoy the picture 
-1,They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile It s horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant NOT GOOD for the business at all especially when your a regular This needs attention Immediately to earn the people s business 
-1,Cold fries Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn t melted The m ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter Then subpar at best 
-1,Bad service that don t give me what you order
-1,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service I am not sure if it s because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying Never has my sauce order been correct Never Even when I pay for it Even when I ask and confirm at the window It s awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag 
-1,Ok so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets I personally prefer the Wendy s spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting The McDonald s Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat But mine were extremely dry and hard one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting I can say I tried them but I was not impressed 
-1,food is typically put together well however curbside is a minimum of minutes once you pull up Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their food might as well go through the drive thru
-1,Unfortunately today while waiting in line pulled to the side not in the drive through lane my frappe was given to the person behind me She graciously didn t take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it I waited mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back I was very confused by this especially in Covid times I requested a different drink no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this 
-1,The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare We have coupons with the McDonald s app The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them because she was tired of having to ring then up My wife and I went to the restaurant today and she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all I m going to try and avoid this McDonald s in the near future 
-1,Slow af I don 
-1,Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day
-1,I ve been going to this location most of my life since it s not far from my home So I ve seen this McDonald s go through a lot of changes The employees here generally have decent attitudes there are a few that tend to be rude The store is also dirty a lot of the time It s a very busy location and maybe it s from having a lot of foot traffic but the floor is usually dirty the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky the ketchup area will be out of ketchup and or there will be ketchup all over the place too The tables tend to be dirty too you usually have to clean off your own table Also they have those light up tables that kids like and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there and they won t be eating and they ll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours And mind you these tables seat about and there will be one homeless person sitting there My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights and I ll have to tell him he can t because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table is camping there The employees don t seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours but buying anything Sometimes they ll even be sleeping at the table The kid s play area is also really crappy They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace They have of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly or at all When I was a kid they had a huge playplace which they took out when they remodeled the store It even had N s at one point along with the playplace But they took it all out and replaced it with a sitting place instead of a playplace It s really awful So all in all this McDonald s is dirty has a lot of homeless people that practically live there and isn t really kid friendly The food is okay as long as it s hot food I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong and the employees are generally friendly but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster meaning that you can tell they don t want to be there This location needs a lot of work And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there There hasn t been a single time I ve gone there that there wasn t at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself The table is by the front counter too and you can often times smell the homeless person that s sitting there the whole time you re waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks It is not kid friendly at all at this store With the store being in a nicer part of town you d expect quite a bit more cleanliness 
-1,Get a veggie burger already God 
-1,I ve had good and bad experiences here Haven t had ti
-1,Ordered fillet o fish sandwiches after not having McDonald s for months ordered Xtra cheese got extra tarter instead Had it remade got no tarter no extra cheese again This is why ppl are mad you make such a high wage 
-1,The food was at McDonald s standards But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average Garbage cans overflowing Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn t draining Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher You couldn t even set your cups down to fill them up 
-1,Pretty much the definition of meh and ok service Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful She had the worst I don t care kind of attitude Worst yet I believe she was the shift last or manager Either way if you don t care for the customer service the food is usually on par 
-1,It s pm line is SUPER LONG Waited a quite of bit of time just to order So be prepared Food was hot and fresh piece nugget meal 
-1,Everything Very good but I ask for fresh fries and the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries and I said no fresh fries are fried in the moment they should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the moment because the customer is very important for us and period 
-1,It took us mins to get to order and get our drinks So slow very disappointing 
-1,Drive thru is not what it use to be They take far to long to be fast food because I thought it suppose to be seconds And half the time they mess up my order 
-1,This McDonald s chicken sandwich tasted like they changed the cooking oil once a year nasty Plus they always forget something by th
-1,Bummed The girl behind the counter was so helpful Pretty upsetting that ALL of the sandwiches in my order were wrong Yay my fries were right 
-1,The food is ok The price is ok If you go through the drive through they always make you pull forward because your food isn t ready yet 
-1,Very slow Drive thru line was wrapped around the building so I went in to order Took minutes to get a cheeseburger and fries 
-1,The morning crew is professional to they are a stellar group but the midnight shift is horrible food is cold desserts we re squashed and when I showed them the muffins she said that s how they came out 
-1,Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly
-1,They seemed like they gave me old food and the fries was to hard and the buns as well
-1,Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets 
-1,Nice employees but waited min for cold food
-1,McD s needs to stop messing with the sodas 
-1,Lost my order while the place was almost empty Chicken tenders were overcooked 
-1,They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never fresh but it s a standard place 
-1,I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was tough and undercooked I do not recommend 
-1,As has been for the last year slow slow service Went inside this time no better 
-1,Dirty slow inefficient They now bring your food to your table They forgot me So my food was colder than usual 
-1,Pictures are misleading No way does that chicken sandwich is so big liar liar pants on fire 
-1,Well don t ask them for a cup of ice you might be lucky to get six cubes
-1,Wrong orders watch what they give you double order lanes mean double mistakes
-1,It s ok the service stinks took too long
-1,That s all you get Service is mediocre 
-1,Customer service pm is awful on morning regularly personnel is better
-1,Yuck 
-1,At least they got my order right 
-1,Nice people but made us feel sick 
-1,Slowest McDonalds in the world and cold french fries
-1,Not the best place to go your Older is never right
-1,No Greeting no smiles poor customer service 
-1,Very slow service today 
-1,Long line at drive thru
-1,Slow and food was cold
-1,Fun times
-1,Dirty and slow service
-1,Good iced tea 
-1,didnt give it star because the food was good but around days ago i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald s app code to get the points i ordered something that was dollars in total and they charged me dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald s app code to another car order my card is linked to the app and I ended up paying for their food i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said yeah I think that car is using my code the guy just said is your lucky day go to the next window It was late at night so I didn t give it much thought because I didn t know just by giving your code you can get charged but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice Tried calling but they didn t solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review
-1, adults ww children breakfast meals Had to go back to service counter times no eggs in meal Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat No apologies were given 
-1,Went through the drive thru and had a pre order They rushed us through they were busy then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong Not even worth going back for It s happened multiple times at this location 
-1,It was a clean and convenient location but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard no pickles no onions We received a fully loaded quarter pounder AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food She made no effort to offer the food She made us get it where she was McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there 
-1,They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate They are not very intuitive at all My order took three times as long to be brought out Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered fish sandwich and something else Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back 
-1,Atmosphere is cool and unique Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks The wait time was forever service was definitely slow But it was also Easter and spring break weekend But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra minutes for our fries and milkshakes That was weird and frustrating 
-1,The kids wanted it the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries it s McDonald s the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive but you can t complain well it s like say your order and here s your meal lol but it s McDonald s
-1,Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible no one is taken the in house orders only drive thru is being taken care of I ve been standing here for minutes until I got to put in my order not a word said to me about the wait only of the desserts have labels Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken After receiving my order McDonald s employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen One customer said she didn t know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald s employee to continue to wait I finally got my order after minutes after coming in through the door 
-1,This morning went through the drive thru for my breakfast Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin Paid and advanced to the next window Here is where things went wrong The blue shirt manager last name begin with an A on duty Had a serious attitude She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee She said the there is no coffee on the order I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP Which is her job Her Words loud and clear FOR GOD SAKE I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don t justify getting attitude because this is your job I ask for a refund 
-1,I ve never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway Father s Day drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for mins This one has two separate planes to order The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles when paying we were barely acknowledged but the worse was to come When at the next window to get our food the person did not even look at me literally just handed a bag out the window then handed the drink out the same way partially angled down towards me Better yet check out the new crispy chicken deluxe 
-1,I ordered my food for pick up and when I walked into the restaurant it was cluttered with guests meandering about which I understood the behavior after MY minute wait that was AFTER I waited minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee So frustrating staffing seemed adequate just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager 
-1,Dine In is NOT available I went with family but we had to sit outside This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables 
-1,Customer service needs some serious work MOBILE APP was the first words out the the drive thru cashier s mouth not even a Welcome to McDonald s And the Egg McMuffin bread was hard Not a good experience 
-1,Typical mcdonalds I guess The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross Should of been tossed out entirely
-1,They messed my order up times They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw They have nasty attitudes You have to use the kiosk to place your order There is no more service with a smile An update I now have food poisoning form the raw undercooked chicken I was served yesterday Don t eat here I will never come back here ever again My reviews have been see by over people 
-1,Disappointing for the largest McDonald s Most menu s items were unavailable when we came in Service is subpar Kids had fun in hame rooms 
-1,They took minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldn t take that long and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold I m wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better but with most options out of stock I can t recommend going
-1,Could only order from kiosk Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English
-1,We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on idrive We were told that we could not eat there but way we were told was very rude 
-1,MacDonalds use to be a fast and friendly palace to order food what a disappointing restaurant with service and attitude 
-1,Granted we at a busy time of the evening SeaWorld was getting ready to close but the lobby to thus McDonald s was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours The drive thru was open but it was exceedingly slow The service was poor and the products we ordered were sub par even for McDonald s standards which is saying something We ended up just throwing some of it away I typically do not leave negative reviews I am hoping that they were just short staffed the night we went 
-1,This is easily the worst McDonalds experience I ve had Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a dirty chaotic nightmare Staff are totally disorganised and management seems non existent Only getting stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the counter it was piping hot and pretty delicious 
-1,This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I don 
-1,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late s bring the food out She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in No offense she was a sweet heart just worried 
-1,Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured bucket of salt on them This is not the first time I ve encountered cold overly salted food
-1,Too crowded inside and in the drive thru Did not get a chance to eat there Looks nice though 
-1,When I first pulled up to get breakfast at am the man told me to come back in mins I said what is this You mean I can t order food right now Yall start breakfast from am and go until am He said ok you can order but food won t be ready for at least min What was weird is soon as I ordered my food was already ready This particular McDonald s is way to busy and big to be pulling slack workers like that The guy seemed like he just didn t want to help 
-1,This particular McDonald s was incredibly slow My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they didn t put the pickles on it Overall it took over minutes in the drive through to get my food Not a great showing from a place that is not expected to be great 
-1,Was so excited for my first time coming to the big McDonald s because I was told you could order special menu items First disappointment Second not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasn t even working for over mins a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee that was half melted Very disappointing Will NEVER go back The employees were all chi
-1,Line for drive thru was slow and when we got up to order literally a third of the menu said that it was not in stock Be back soon We ended up not ordering 
-1,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders There was a giant mob waiting at the register s for their orders Be smarter with your manning 
-1,Largest and slowest in the world Took minutes from when I drove up till I left Took minutes to get my food after I paid Also I did not get a good morning or anything except The cost of my food Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there All for sausage biscuits and a coffee 
-1,I would give stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and star for the sausage burritos The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside It s been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald s has definitely gone downhill Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money 
-1,Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because cars had passed on my right while i was waiting Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another more min I have now been waiting min for my items If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait I would not have felt forgotten at the window 
-1,Service is slow and painful lost McDouble Bundle option on menu for budget minded customers Still giving it stars because employees aren t paid enough to say Have a Good Day when you getting order at pick up window Change my mind next time I drive through and you ll get more stars Like what you see Just say OYE The Blond One 
-1,Ordered curbside The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take minutes and he couldn t cancel it He said he can substitute for cookies minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie Frustrating Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct
-1,Inconsistency on preparing my daily French vanilla latte Some times perfect sometimes bitter sometimes similar to the much less expensive regular black Also very inconsistent on getting special orders correct Very friendly crew 
-1,There s only way to describe my experience Have you ever gone in to a daycare and shook a basket full of babies well I haven t but I could imagine what it sounds like and that s how it sounded when I walked in the doors I didn t order anything and the employees were on there phones anyways So 
-1,The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about minutes before they could even take an order I m a local and I wouldn t ever go back to this location again Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area Also clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English This is difficult if you re trying to ask anything of the clerk Would not recommend 
-1,Sorely disappointed Outlets in every wall and not a single one working The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked so kudos to him Place was clean enough I guess 
-1,On Saturday at am drive through is moving at to minutes per car which works out to about to minutes to get your food from when order was placed Also only use lane and you will go faster 
-1,We were not impressed with this location They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive through We made it inside but that wasn t much better The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk 
-1,All that technology and they can t remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens 
-1,You wouldn t expect it but it s not as good as it is in europe not to mention if you ll go there really hungry by the time they ll serve you you ll starve 
-1,I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries I even heard them making comments about the free coupon Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times I stopped by times in one week and had an issue each time The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the stars instead of 
-1,Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on at around pm The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda Great Management Skills 
-1,Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits If you can go a few miles down the road the Sand Lake location on I drive is much better 
-1,Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about mins start to finish For being a fast food they are super slow They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job My French fries were cold One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people 
-1,The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok She then gave me a piece nugget instead of I don t know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully Usually go to this location at least times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location
-1,Don t know why but ever since the rebuild of this site the burgers are unbearable Never juicy dry and unfavorable as can be From the little burgers to the quarter pounder it s the same Doesn t even taste like meat anymore They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months but we ll over a year now and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard What happened 
-1,Wrong order through the drive thru Doesnt surprise me any more with this location Glad I m not allergic to the items I requested to be removed 
-1,Often very slow bc of the flood of people Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy If you use the mobile app stick to drive thru I waited minutes for curbside pick up and minutes in lobby I recommend getting back in your car and going to Chick fil A You ll be there and back with your food before anything hap
-1,Super slow to get food It appears drive thru got all the attention minutes to get food is too long Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price
-1,I would rate it a star but people would not take my review seriously I visited this restaurant last night It was very clean including the bathroom At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register This wasn t possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk they had to get a receipt and pay at the register I left minutes later and went to Wendy s when the line had barely moved 
-1,I ve had one really positive experience at this McDonald s and one really negative First time they were super fa
-1,New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk very frustrating Also the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn t broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike 
-1,Not Brother bringing food food to table long wait and don 
-1,This is not the worlds biggest McDonald 
-1,The employee s are nice location is always dirty Tables have to be clean more often The food quality has gotten better 
-1,Order is wrong everytime i have went or missing items 
-1,Ordered the Quarter pounders deluxe with cheese no pickle and one with no onion They both had no lettuce and tomato on them I call them about it and they were glad to replace them I go back and mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them nevergetitright McDonalds
-1,extremely busy highly understaffed waited hr in drive thru last resort for my food this is not fast food 
-1,Past recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing Not an example of fast food 
-1,It has been min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them 
-1,Pretty cool but didn t drive a hour drive to for the cashier to catch a attitude wi
-1,Wait for my order over minutes drive thru Deluxe with extra onions Fries where soggy Had to go back inside to get fresh fries Looked under staffed
-1,The service was awful and rude They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing 
-1,Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the employee s table Noisy and confused environment Not for business people Has a minute time limit on Internet 
-1,Quite literally one of the worst McDonald s ever Staff is incompetent unfriendly and doesn t get the order right or the food is OLD As the manager of a room resort I advise all of my guests to detour this location 
-1,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers weren t working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma 
-1,The nuggets from this location were the WORST I ve ever had Unfortunately I didn t taste them until I d gotten back to my room otherwise I d definitely have asked for my money back 
-1,Sloooooow service PM and just got a cheeseburger small fries from drive thru because I was late for a meeting Took minutes for this simple order Really for a burger fries 
-1,Got nuggets and fries Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries Got no barbeque or ketchup good thing we went to the big mcdonalds enjoying dry nuggets now At least the food was hot 
-1,Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly staff 
-1,In almost all McDonald s I have been going have self order post The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right No help you need to l look ace the order again 
-1,Fries were very cold children s burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service wasn t terrible but food put out was 
-1,Slow service and attendents don t acknowledge customers I ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat but it was slow
-1,THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Definitely not coming back 
-1,They can t handle a lot of customer Waited minutes for my order outside
-1,So they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines Ugh Place smells like disinfectant and bleach charges tourist prices 
-1,Service was very slow Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited minutes for their orders
-1,Was under staffed long wait order was gotten wrong
-1,All self ordering machines food took forever to come out drink machine didn t work
-1,No vegeterian options
-1,Horrible service You could tell the food had been sitting I asked for more and it was the same The milkshake machine is never working or they say they are cleaning it They clean it at the wrong times I DO NOT recommend this McDonald s 
-1,About half of my visits are pretty terrible but it s a drive thru option that s on my way to work Today my bacon egg and cheese bagel had no bacon for a missing ingredient is absolutely ridiculous 
-1,I ve been ordering from this location via Uber Eats for a couple of years They are no longer able serve an acceptable Breakfast Burrito OLD CRUNCHY NUKED TO THE PAPER WRAPPING Why It can t be laziness It s their business training poor EVERY TIME all other items are fine except for this item 
-1,Unwilling to keep someone at the register I had to yell after standing alone over minutes to get their attention
-1,Customer service sucks When I get to the nd window no talking they just hang my drink out the window and then shove my food out I ordered a bacon quarter pounder plain and I get a mc double with extra mac sauce times in a row my order was messed up not returning 
-1,Still a good place to go to but it seems that the management rather serve drive thru than inside service Having to wait for the drive thru to finish before waiting on inside customers makes you want to go somewhere else 
-1,Checkout took forever Only cashier Didn t receive my drink cup had to ask for it as well as the size also staffer didn t give us the milkshake ordered No sense of Urgency They need to be more like Chick Filet I heard several ordered after mine weren t right Disappointed 
-1,I was helped by two different people Neither one said thank you Or anything at all Just shoved receipts and food in my face Updating my review Weeks later and this is still the case 
-1,This McDonald s needs to improve The facility is good and updated The food service is slow They also mess up our orders often at drive through in particular It appears that the employee turn around is high so I don t really see regular employees here for long 
-1,New look is Dark Unfriendly and less seating finding a new Bright family friendly MCDONALD S
-1,They mixed up on my order no sausage or syrup had to go back to ask for it
-1,The service is not slow but the customer service is not where it should be

-1,When this McDonald s first opened OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme The animatronics made noise and moved The service WAS excellent But now it looks like a tourist trap Some days you ll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it s quality that it had As far as the food goes Well it s McDonald s same as any other 
-1,They where not friendly The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt Got to the nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot Waited at least mins before anyone came out to our car Asked what we ordered and for our receipt which we didnt have Finally brought our food out and burgers where wrong 
-1,Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ish and the location although you d think is convenient after visiting the zoo It s a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location 
-1,Awful experience It was and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets I order my tea in the drive through line The line was pretty long When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes said they could only take cash I said what I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word I said for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea She looked strange and I said please let me speak to your manager She spoke to someone and the manager said no and wouldn t come to the window AWFUL 
-1,Always something with this location Either system down only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights
-1,Same ol ready in minutes food Idk how they do it But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave Great Job Mickey D s
-1,Well it might have been ok if I was not rushing but I still stayed for my items For this to be McDonald s they should know that it s busier during certain hours then others there were soo many ppl in line the average person would have turn right back around n walked out 
-1,The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins Even after you ve ask Then soon as you drive away You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to 
-1,Burgers are always flat Good for on the road food I sure do miss the dollar menus tho And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets humm
-1,Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still can t receive it what s the point of leaving a note if no one reads it I ve order different times and never fail to disappoint me
-1,My family and I get to this McDonald s we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no The Wi Fi here is not even strong enough I could not complete my homework Bummed out Not the best as usual 
-1,The customer service is just not what it used to be There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help I ended up payimg for someone elses order At st i thought it was more but it was cents less I m glad i only go there for drinks

-1,I saw them hand mixing a shake and my Mcflurry wasnt even mixed Best thing here are the animal sculptures 
-1,Just a rude staff who seem to have a bad attitude Order was correct and fine just rude people 
-1,By far one of the dirtiest McDonald s I ve ever been to dirty tables the entire time we were there No hand sanitizer

-1,Awful service they had ran out of everything so we had to order quarter pounders two large fries and reg cokes the sodas were mixed with diet and something else and the quarter pounders were made with three hamburger meets and they were stuffed with Mayo and like pickles disgusting They made a mess out of the order it was late and somehow dollars later all all we had were three cups of water and one quarter pounder When I asked to Speak to the manager the youn
-1,Homeless people walking on the restaurant asking for money Employees ignore it 
-1,Bad costomer service slow workers
-1,the slowest mc Donalds in the world It is supposed to be hours but they leave it closed to customers and by car mac it takes minutes per customer I mean I wasted h of my life waiting for such a bad and slow service
-1,Almost everything I order was wrong I order a Sunday with chocolate syrup and they brought me caramel I also order and paid extra for bbq sauce and they didn t put any the food was also cold Worst restaurant 
-1,Warning Check your order every time you come to this location Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered Don t let them tell you
-1,Cant hate on the workers its Mcdonalds just dont go to this location And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next hours
-1,They won t mess up your order but you will sit in the drive through for at least minutes before you get to order and then wait another minutes to get your food Overall unless it s your only option you should drive on to a better run McDonalds 
-1,I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers The worst part is that one of the managers a young latino kid was engaged in of these conversations I asked the manager why he wasn t controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed 
-1,Went late one night to the drive thru and was told they were closed I pulled forward and someone was paying for their meal I thought this was a location 
-1,Used drive thru at am finally got my food at am They have two lanes for offering and only one window to dispatch food for those plus the uber drivers on foot at the window waiting for their orders Food was kind of cold fries and breaded chicken tasted like burned oil and on top of that they didn t put any mayonnaise or ketchup for the fries These big chains have no quality control It s actually sad when you compare the food from the picture to what you really get 
-1,Slow service manager working register and takeout not enough help 
-1,Ordered piece nuggets and they were not fresh and were very hard like they were overcooked Also gave me the wrong sauce 
-1,Didn 
-1,Medium coffee is almost dollars and it 
-1, at night and sitting in mine for minutes and the line hasn 
-1,Out of cups wouldnt give a side of sauce through the drive thru stopped listening half way through my order
-1,Ordered kiddy meals and juices were left out and they forgot the apples Horrible service Never again here 
-1,Such slow service in the drive thru every single time I am here I made my order mins a go and I still haven 
-1,To go order without napkins no sauces asked BBQ for the nuggets Diet Coke was a mix of flavors 
-1,Poor service I had a nugget medium fries a m caramel frappe and medium mocha frappe they charged me for a small mocha and salad dressing she charged me the difference but they almost gave me a small I had to ask why they charged me that also they neglect to let you know they dont have caramel or chocolate and when I asked they just told me there isn t any with attitude
-1,Didn t understerstand or couldn t understand simple English Drinks moslty ice diluting flavor Ask for no ice and get a cup of ice separate 
-1,Very slow employee take forever to get you order Im not recommended to any body this place
-1,Kind person that cant manage to get an order right times I had to come back to get the order redone Kind cashier everything else about this place sucks 
-1,What s up with this Lady taking Hours every morning to clean just the men s restroom this is every morning and don t even ask her to let you in just to wash hands she ll send you to ypur house or women s restroom 
-1,Slow employees not being really kind to many uber eats before you not too much attention on the place being clean 
-1,I today sat in line For minutes for a order They need more staff if that case
-1,Food was ok for Mickey D s But the basket was horrible Didn t care Didn t even wanna be there Didn t want my business 
-1,Very dirty place Restrooms without toilet paper Cooked burger in wrong way against directions placed in the order Not recommend 
-1,Saw the manager come out the back picking his nose straight up digging for gold in that thing then start serving people with no gloves CmonSon
-1,Poor attention from the team casher and manager discrimination against homeless person that wanted to buy food Not a recommended place to visit 
-1,Thru the years I have seen how the people working in this particular mcDonald s changed for the worse 
-1,Too much wait at midnight Burger had unsatisfing taste and coke had no soda
-1,Waited in line for half an hour and it seemed like forever at the pick up window I asked if they were short staffed and she said they were waiting on the fries But when I got them they were cold She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting
-1,this McDonald s is more expensive than others in the area and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them 
-1,Frequently at this location someone is spewing toxic gases into the air violating local laws humane rights despite a security guard on site Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction such as because the US doesn t mint dollar bills and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mike s g string If this location has take out hours dining room hours that should be posted on entry ways online Otherwise we patrons expect to sit down not be told the seating area is closed minutes prior to closing and minutes after opening MGMT should schedule site employee hours accordingly 
-1,Did not help me with a refund and took awhile to convince worker to take a look at kiosk to fix it 
-1,Honestly the worst McDonald s you d expect more from one by the beach and turns out to be the worst experience 
-1,Full of homeless people not like I m unaware of our global situation with homelessness but if you looking to sit down chill and eat don t do it at this one It doesn t have a drive thru so order ahead for pick up it does have self service ordering kiosk 
-1,SOOOO busy all I ordered was a drink and who knows who actually got it 
-1,This is hands down THE worst McDonald s ever The staff are rude racist and intentionally slow Don t waste your time There was a fistfight in the dining area and the men s room was full of weed smoke 
-1,Order was screwed up and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process SAD 
-1,Had to go and wipe my star review and turn it to a star since last year this whole place has turned into yet another slow Hispanic ran restaurant Used to have a diverse staff and be consistently speedy and hot now it takes mins with no one else in line to get some fries and nuggets while everyone is standing around twiddling their thumbs I ve been here at least times and every time I ve been here post COVID reopening it s been this same situation with the change of the whole employee personnel now it 
-1,The locations looks great and has of machines that allow you to order and pay but the service was horrible I ordered a sundae for my mom and after minutes of waiting I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered minutes prior I was given a refund without fuss before leaving The bad part to all of this was there were about people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly 
-1,It s a McDonald s that food is the same as every other McDonald s is decent didn t like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice
-1,The People Who Work There Were Very Rude Short In Response There Parking Garage Is Hazardous 
-1,They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat The problem is their smell We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed 
-1,Manager sucks I called her over for help and she ignored me Seating arrangements are disorganized The soda fountain machine is always dirty Hardly any ice When you press for a certain soda it runs water for a while Too many homeless people The only decent thing here is the food 
-1,I expect crowding because it s close to the beach The ice machine is always out they don t have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container and some of the employees have attitude The security guard tends to trip but it s not always the same guard Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers I only go there because of proximity 
-1,No Refills It took about minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done They could only give you ranch for Chicken Nuggets not even Fo
-1,Loads of homeless people around
-1,No drive thru there is a parking lot area very busy and chaotic service was reasonable 
-1,Food was not hot fries to salty
-1,At first I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey D s But then while getting back home which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad So I had to stop at Carl s Jr on Newhall for the bathroom 
-1,Too many homeless hang out in front of here A lot of them are violent No drink refills here because people would take cups out of the trash and steal soda 
-1,Massive homelessness dirty outside No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door 
-1,Rude cashier Dirty seats and tables And full of very crazy looking people drugs i felt a little bit uncomfortable The Hot chocolate didn t taste like HC at all 
-1,My experience visiting this place was not good It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service This McDonald s offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things I have to wait more then an hour and minutes for it The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem The staff attention was not good They were overwhelmed and didn t warning about the long waiting time In some cases one hour and a half This is considered the largest McDonald s in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city They should improve their service especially in the pizza area As a positive comment I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry with a large group and during busy times 
-1,This is the slowest McDonald s I ve ever experienced The staff is difficult to deal with and out of times our order is wrong Great location and clean facilities though 
-1,Are use my mobile app this morning I waited to hear your associates voice he say go on with your order When I order it he didn t asked me if I wante
-1,Very busy place No soda was available when ordering 
-1,Poor 
-1,Poor 
-1,They allow you to order on the mobile app for pickup until when they physically close their doors at so you have to wait at a little window Wouldn t have o
-1,Cashier on turn Apr at a pretend didn t hear when when I asked twice please repeat the order just told me go to the next window of course the order was wrong
-1,My experience was ok They forgot little things in my order like a straw for iced tea and cream and sugar that i requested The wifi is not available like they stated when searching for wifi there is no mcdonals wifi instead it was a wired name like EBOS The connection did not allow for simple web browsing For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios This place is ok 
-1,Lines are SOOO long and extremely slow everytime I come here I don t know why the staff is so i
-1,High volume drive thru with heavy wait time This McDonald s can t handle amount of people that here If you want to wait a long time for the meal Then you came to the right palce
-1,The parking lot is one of the worst All the spots are way too narrow and cramped 
-1,Used the app to order but took minutes to get it to me at the counter That s way too long Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up The only thing going for this place is that it s Hours drive through And dont use the app relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs Update this place is torn down The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll Too bad cuz the hour drive thru was pretty convenient 
-1,Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long After bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food I m from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasn t an option 
-1,I m not sure what s wrong with this location but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold Today I went through the drive thru and they had a rush there were about cars ahead of me So I m not sure how they can serve me cold food when they re constantly feeling orders Just extremely disappointed with this location I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder
-1,I ve given this location a few chances over the last two years and while the drive thru is fast the drinks taste wrong every time Something about their soda machine is just not working like other locations and hasn t been for a long time 
-1,There s a young man here that goes by the name of Muhammad He is extremely rude Not an exaggeration He has no concept whatsoever of customer service He pointed at me and started demanding me to walk over to him because of a mistake he made He 
-1,Every time I ve eaten there I ve never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table Always sticky and I ve had to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating I d think they would at least watch and take care of this situation Also very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast I ve asked if they could turn the AC down a bit but they said they couldn t Picking another MD now 
-1,The drive thru girl lied to me and the mgr stepped in to assist and the next time I went there I started out happy and said hi She did not answer wierdo Not cool to hold grudges I don t Every day is a new day and a chance to clean up messes She could fix it and apologize but she chooses to ack like a child 
-1,The drive through at this McDonald s has always been busy every time I ve gone It s honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry I ve been stuck in the drive thru line for over minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger Granted compared to In and Out that s nothing but this is McDonalds That aside the interior has always been pretty clean when I ve went inside If you go for breakfast on the weekends once again be prepared to wait They do take Apple Pay and Android pay The one time I used it the person behind the counter actually knew what it was So many places tell you they don t have it but just don t know what it is Another big plus is the drive through is hours 
-1,My brother and I tolerate it because it s close to us and it s open when no one else is But you get the loonies showing up there Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine Smells psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick 
-1,bad night went for a burger got trapped in the drive thru took almost ten min to get to the order screen only to find out their grill was down and they aren t cooking meat just nuggets trapped for another ten minutes for a total of almost twenty minutes with nothing to show for it things happen just put a damn sign up 
-1,Happy it 
-1,t s fast food they take like for an order and all the tables are dirty
-1,It takes forever to get breakfast here every time inside and out
-1,Cold nuggets Homeless people just walking around cars 
-1,It s a McDonald s so the food is very consistent Unfortunately the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it I ve been stuck in the parking lot for minutes with no way to get out 
-1,Gross bathrooms you know it s sketchy because they have security outside of it 
-1,Like stepping back into the s this place hasn t been updated for many decades by the looks of it Very old fashioned Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonald s branches I ve been to 
-1,Today restaurant is closed for renovation no date when will reopen but Google maps shows as open 
-1,The McDonald s I just went to was so filthy I didn t even eat there The parking lot was disgusting all around the outside of the building was really filthy Inside was better but not by that much 
-1,How do you mess up this many orders And the fries were weird Just go to a different McDonald s
-1,Dining room has gnats Told employee but no reaction Maybe the gnats amoing others is why i raely go Was in a giant hurry only reason
-1,Bad customer service rude they lie about giving u condiments Food is usually missing when u get home 
-1,There is an entrance fee upon entering and exiting the drive thru LOL

-1,Very dirty and staff is not friendly at all They act like they don t like their jobs
-1,My cup was fingered by the cashier Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked 
-1,Not good for health as we all know but a little good food
-1,Disgusting I love McDonald s but some franchises don t know how to cook the food and this is one of them 
-1,Small place recomended for drive thru or take out
-1,Typical McDonald s just with REALLLLLLLY long drive thru lines Nothing special nothing to write home about 
-1,Really long SLOW line at the drive through Took FOREVER 
-1,Unorganized Couldn

-1,Very rude female employee Look like she didnt wanted to work
-1,Worst food ever The hamburgers taste like a paper 
-1,there was a hair in our food
-1,I got sloppy vanilla ice cream cones today 
-1,Ok food service and prices difference from all other
-1,VERY SAD HOMELESS OUTSIDE LURKING AROUND NO CHRISTMAS MUSIC OR SPIRIT INSIDE 
-1,parking is a nightmare WAY too many homeless near by
-1,Drive thru is pretty slow 
-1,Dirty Tight parking lot Too many homeless people 
-1,No tomatoes Did not inform when ordering 
-1,Convient probably would avoid if it wasn t right there 
-1,Attendant didn t listen to what I ordered

-1,Check orders Sauces are not included Long time to cook
-1,I ordered a fish burger and it only brings the bread the fish and mayonnaise I expected it to bring lettuce and tomato but no I think it would be better with luchuga and tomato
-1,Poor 
-1,the heavy set woman with the short cut quick weave with glasses is very rude and miserable looking i stood there waiting on the doordash order for min and she didnt ask how could she help me she didn t say anything she was skipping over the doordash order and just let me stand there then when the order was done she threw the bag
-1,Poor 
-1,Perhaps the most poorly run McDonald s in Texas Visited on the weekend so naturally busier but the management attitude of employees and physical condition make this a location in my opinion the worst location we ve ever visited Trash everywhere see pic for example Trash on the floors tables parking lot Dirty tables Obviously tables get dirty So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitor s
-1,Frys were cold did not give me my large drink that was ordered and when I asked for my receipt people just walked around lost said forget it and left 
-1,Delivery complete joke Don t bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets I ordered spicy reg picked out at least different dipping sauces as required not to mention Desired by my kiddos We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard they didn t even give us straws either to go with our mango smoothies of them So Nuggets NO sauces AT ALL Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious 
-1,Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back
-1,The food is fine Service at the drive through is horrendous Unprofessional and unhelpful It s good that ther
-1,I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that that s the way its supposed to be I managed a McDonald s for many years I know better I still order their food regularly all over the country I know better The new manager has made things much better but standards still slip back to the old ways when he s not here 
-1,This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store there are always problems with food last time I went over there I had cold cheese burgers had to wait for my wife s food and came the wrong way If you want to eat bacon tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers there are just piece to none hahaha 
-1,Food was good Everything was right but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex which is really just for boys and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little yr old daughter She is obviously not into a avengers 
-1,They watered their parking lot with a poorly engineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freeze let everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke 
-1,This McDonalds sucks They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive thru but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds The management The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive thru timer because you will always have to pull up at this McD s Always Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times burger fry at pm pull up next to the other cars already there The one manager I ve had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order that I had to pull up and wait for more than minutes for no less and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash The best part He made me pull up to get the cash So again Mis managed terrible McDonalds It s a franchise for a reason this one just stinks 
-1,They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru Very slow Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number with nothing special added Seriously a quarter pounder takes extra time to make Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds 
-1,Urger buns taxted stale Fries were little more than broken potato sticks Absolutely terrible location 
-1,Girl taking orders in the drive through didn t listen very well Asked for hashbrowns it was never added to my order I said it times 
-1,The ladies restroom smell horrible Moldy and mildew y smell Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask 
-1,Charged me for someone else who already drove offs meal Then got my order wrong Spent minutes for fast food in the drive thru
-1,Order some food and they forgot to give me my Cheeseburgers I always check the bag before I leave I told them and the girl said it was in there I told her you want to come and check 
-1,The service at this McDonald s is always spotty this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general
-1,We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke we only get a drink there I m so we only go to for the play area and since it s broke my son has been very sad
-1,The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the McDonald s app 
-1,There worse Wet lettuce or dead Fries or nasty burnt dried up Sunday Sept Made attempt to call management but kept hanging up there phone This restaurant needs to shut down 
-1,How do you miss a patty on a big mac First time going there too 
-1,Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who gave me my food She was very kind and polite to me 
-1,Sat in the drive thru for about to min because they were very busy and still got very cold food Took the fries back Very disappointed 
-1,The worst Attitudes Cold fries twice The clerk gave the cleaning guy my order in the middle of him sweeping the floor to bring to my car Unsanitary nd time the order was still wrong Food wasn t good at all Won t be going back 
-1,Incorrect hours I arrived at in the morning and was informed that they still closed
-1,I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night and waited for about minutes as they only took orders from the other lane I was not able to back up my car so I went forward to ask what was up When I got to the only window open they said they were only taking orders from one side I suggested they put up a sign and asked if could take my order at the window they said I would have to go through the drive thru again I am not going here anymore for this in addition to the times they got my order wrong 
-1,One of the worst with service I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup So I go inside I wait at pickup Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals So I try to be patient stood there for like min and never received my drink They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it Also they never sent the cashier who was struggling by herself no help 
-1,Fries soggy most of the time Soda gets bad constantly Gave me seltzer water instead of soda Sandwiches not bad except that they re dry sometimes Customer service anything else After every single request instead of would you care to try our new 
-1,No to all of that Always a long line The kids working the drive thru are always in a bad mood Orders get mixed up and the fries toddle between not being fresh to being freshly made in old oil I will stop there 
-1,Couldn t get a simple order correct so had to wait Asked specifically for something still forgot it and had to go in and ask again And food was subpar McDonald s standards so that saying something it was at least cleaner than most also at this point saying something
-1,The apple pies here were the worst It was like biting into a regular apple The only thing cooked was the outside The inside was cold and the apples were hard I went there to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat I won t be going back there I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for weeks This was their choice of reward for good behavior 
-1,With as much staff as was on hand there is no reason I should have waited longer than minutes but I did I was not happy with my order when I got it Nor was my body satisfied when it went down If you want to try this place knock yourself out 
-1,Sorry what i have to said but this place always is a mess Everytime you going to this restaurant have to wait a lot for your food just because the employes always been around they place of work talk like they are on the street in ocasion i hear said bad word when the costumer been inside the store honestly they need better cordination at the time of work 
-1,Order was wrong Paid for double hamburgers received single hamburgers Drive thru took forever despite being empty 
-1,The service is slow Order anything more complex than a cheeseburger and you are sent to the side to wait for your order On top of that your order is often wrong so always check 
-1,Service and the food here REALLY suck I ve been there a few times after work which is after midnight and always end up kicking myself in the ankle for doing so my order is NEVER complete NEVER chicken nuggets no sauce salad no dressing I ll pay for some cookies or apple pies and nothing not in the bag and to add insult to injury the food that does make it into the bag seems like its been sitting around for hours way to save a buck mickey dee s skip this place if you can trust me 
-1,The workers there are not professional i went in there to get my morning coffee and heard one of the girls using profanity and customes can over hear them then the cashier told me to give her a second and she went to the drive through window and start taking customers at the window while there was already someone there handling the drive through customers i stood at the cash register close to mins to place my order then on another occasion i placed my order on the mobile app the young lady made my ice coffee and left it by the machine another team member asked what i was waiting for i then told her my ice coffee the girl that made it told her im waiting on my ice coffee too mins later im still standing there without my coffee then the girl turned around and saw me standing there still then saw the coffee sitting there and eventually handed it to me and note i was the only customer left in the McDonalds other customers came in placed their order got their stuff and left a long time ago im suggesting more training for these individuals working at this location I have observed this for a while now and said nothing I turn my head everytime i pass there now if you re running late for work i suggest walking through the drive through you ll get your order more faster than going in 
-1,It s absurd how bad the service is here I wouldn t recommend going through the drive through They ll mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it again I d say just ignore this McDonald s entirely but if you do come to this location do yourself a favor Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food restaurant It ll be faster this way 
-1,Really bad service Food was cold And large fries wasn t even full Probably size of a medium Have to do better
-1,Too much waiting seems like the staffs don t know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain 
-1,Not Satisfied after buying Large orders of fries for and was given large containers SERIOUSLY HALF FULL looking like Small or Medium sized fries Very disappointed 
-1,It s my local McDonald s so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the nd drive thru lane But what s the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control Food wise things take a long time usually but it s your normal McDonald s type food except they don t salt their fries well 
-1,This McDonald s has always been bottom of the barrel as far back as I can remember and a sleek face lift doesn t change the fact that a visit to this McDonald s will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one so I ll compile a list Incorrect orders of the time Rude employees and managers Customers who are loud offensive and downright violent Poorly made slapped together food And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company P B S Parking Boot Service and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand cash in exchange for the boot removal It seems this McDonald s is doing everything to lose business They thrive off of convenient location alone Absolutely terrible experience 
-1,Every time I go I don t get what I ask and the some employee are mean
-1,More expensive long and I mean longgggggggghg wait times inside or out Oh and you 
-1,I went in to use the bathroon before i go buy some thing and i saw i had to be Buzz Inn so I went to the front to have me to be buzzed in and I was told no I had to buy something first and the funny thing is I m a diabetic and my sugar was high and I was in pain but I had to buy something first just to be let into the bathroom then when I was let into the bathroom it was so disgusting Know one clean the bathroom the toilet was filled with toilet paper and piss all over the rim of the toilet dry on u can see it and the manager that I m assuming she had like a Jamaican accent and gave me kind of a nasty attitude also i wouldnt recommend it to come here and i was visiting from upstate New York it was a long drive
-1,There are better McDonald locations then here Usually out of times they forget something you ordered 
-1,Seems like they always makes some mistakes when they get busy 
-1,A disappointing visit We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register We waited over minutes for standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders While waiting we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it At that point I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn t realize it hadn t been served We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything They did make our order fresh once we asked for it which is why I gave more that star for the food We would not return to this location 
-1,Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in minutes actually tool close to minutes A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink That is ridiculous 
-1,Complicated kiosk ordering salty fries can order lightly salted decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite 
-1,No one to take your order it s all done on kiosks had to have my ice coffee remade because they couldn t get it right the first time
-1,A clean place with a good airco food is another story Bread of the burgers is dried out french fries were cold No do not go here if you want good food
-1,Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back
-1,Asked for a large water when they brought my order to my table And she never came back 
-1,I GIVE IT STARS because they were quick But on the other hand The fries were cold and the burgers were drenched with ketchup Told the gentleman to hold one moment and seconds later a girl came on Like give us a minute I normally don t write a review and I hate to leave a bad one But you would think because it s in front of oldtown it s hot and fresh Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal 
-1,Food was hot and order came as it was ordered However they had no pop It was okay would i go back sure 
-1,I don t
-1,They forgot my ice cream but I went back and got it The line is very long weekends so go during the week The curbside pickup is excellent I am appending my review this is the second time I ordered and they forgot an item This McDonald s is beyond busy 
-1,Every time I came during my two week visit I was asked to pull forward into the parking spots where the mobile ordering area is there was always cars pulled up waiting for food just so they can make their drive thru times better No one wants to pull forward for you to make your ratings look better Get it together 
-1,Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is 
-1,Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w combo purchase and when I went to check out it said Deal is unavailable wiped out the order forcing me to re enter everything and the deal code was now invalid I get that they are for participating locations but if you re not a participating location put up a sign or something so I don t waste my time The drink fountain was closed to keep the restaurant clean according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said We don t do refills here What Seriously Unlike every other McDonald s You re gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill Again if that is this location s policy fine But post a sign so that the expectation is set
-1,One of my favorite features of McDonald s for me is that I know what I can expect offerings flavors etc This is true for this particular restaurant however it seems that being soooo busy I guess excellent location makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers Running out of lettuce running out of many things are management logistics problems Bad attitude lack of courtesy well I guess that problem is on us the customers right The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still regardless of attitude and bad manners 
-1,Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible see the picture Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month Took forever as well 
-1,Fries were good and hot I also got the crispy chicken sandwich It was hot but seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich I definitely will not get this sandwich again here I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonald s is a major gamble I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all Bland burnt dry etc take my advice don t get the c
-1,Our order was incorrect We ordered a Big Mac meal with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe When we said the coke was supposed to be large the worker Manager asked for the receipt which shows Big Mac Ml Lrg M Coke Then she said You have to ask for a large We did She didn t offer to correct their error When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink The fry was a large but they were cold The Big Mac was dry I forgot why we don t usually go to McDonald s Thank you for reminding me 
-1,Horrible Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich They gave it to me on a plain dry bun with nothing on it Just chicken bread 
-1,We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America I placed a mobile order the cashier didn t know that after standing there for minutes he finally said mobile order I raised my hand and he slide me the bag Never
-1,Says hour drive through They re always closed shut down doing maintenance only cash systems are down or some other reasons why they can t serve the early risers They shouldn t post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers 
-1,Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving Bad move on our part Ordered a filet It was totally hard Not just the bread The fish was a hockey puck Very nasty Had to throw it out The fries were the back up thank goodness for those at least We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay 
-1,This is the only McDonald s I know that decid
-1,Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour If we weren t trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have They didn t give us any napkins and got our order wrong The cashier said it s always like this Absolutely not acceptable Especially for a McDonald s Did they forget what FAST food means 
-1,The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald s was because of my youngest daughter But what we experienced today put an end to it The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving customers in the drive thru area As you noticed there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case The associate instead of been polite talked to us in a not too pleasant tone I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience 
-1,I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work I got a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle the hash brown and a caramel frappe I ended up with food poisoning 
-1,I should never have to wait more than to minutes for fast food Waiting for over minutes in the line now and I still haven t gotten my food I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand This McDonalds sucks
-1,Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional If you are a tourist and don t know when it is cash only you don t get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude 
-1,Only go here because it s open late Food not always the same presentation or great tasting but it is McDonald s What do you expect You know when you go there what you re getting Cheap food poor customer service And maybe your order correct 
-1,All I had was a hot fudge sundae which was good The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda They legally should not have been open They were still running things as usual though 
-1,There is a theme with drive thru only restaurant s cold food and watered down drinks and if don t check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you can t just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again Open up the lobby people
-1,This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald s just down the street for what is normally On top of it didn t even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald s
-1,So disappointed I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order which was Not working No one noticed we were having difficulty So frustrating Wont come here again for a long time 
-1,the drive thru line is super long and aside from that the people who should be taking your order there don t even answer when you get to the ordering station It took us about minutes to get a simple order and that was too long 
-1,Sat in drive thru for very long time to be told no fountain drinks no frappes no coffee and food was meh
-1,The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations making orders fast and reliable Notwithstanding the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff Ultimately the store next to McDonald gives customers a free gift if you bring your McDonald s receipt 
-1,Very busy Very dirty One cashier and at least people working Line was long the boy taking orders was moving at half the speed of smell I watched four groups walk out We should have followed 
-1,I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids and I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag I do not recommend the drive through 
-1,Horrible service General manager was in the store at the time Was punishing an employee in front of everybody Should ve been more professional and took him in the back area I waited minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh Don t recommend this location unless you can t get to a different location 
-1,Very busy mad customers long wait times for orders The staff is trying their best but can t keep up They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor 
-1,During the Daytime its alright but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES HR DINING ROOM So you re forced to drive through I didnt expect much but whatever 
-1,For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger Ordered mcdoubles with cheese and small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger and sadly I started with the fries And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt Never going back Would rather go to checkers across the street 
-1,The price is good using the McDonald s app with the dollar coke what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold They were absolutely been trashed Customer service was good this time 
-1,Ordered mcdouble bundle no ketchup light onions and extra mustard I got cheese and pickles The fries were terrible and my drink was fine 
-1,The never has the coke icee 
-1,Slowest most under staffed McDonald s I have ever been everyone honking on the drive trun people screaming they have been waiting forever very stressful environment 
-1,Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime I came here for days in total Normally I do not eat at McDonald s but this place is very close to where I m staying They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen Still gets my order wrong percent of time What Asks me what drink I want Then I just get the cup so why ask me One day I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom Locator and food is gone Takes me a while to get it sorted out forgets my drink again One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure Gets little sauce on my clothes not too bad but Jesus Christ One night lot of drinks do not work except for coke yuk few other things not worth mentioning They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink Clean 
-1,Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating Doors were locked Drive thru only Needed to sit at a table and eat Decided to eat elsewhere 
-1,Had a crispy chicken sandwich which was ok small case and fries which resembled a form of spaghetti I should of gone to Chick fil A 
-1,I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not They only gave me bbq sauces like who doesn t want ketchup The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again start because it was better then kfc 
-1,Didn t get anything to eat this time because they CLOSE THE LOBBY AT PM Didn t go through the drive thru cause I m on a motorcycle What kind of dingus closes half their store to customers in Old Town 
-1,Food cold and forgot items food was replaced so only star I m afraid
-1,EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING And i mean everytime I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few
-1,They need better customer service The people in the drive thru are so rude that I almost came out my professional skin Get it together McDonalds McDonalds close to go cart place
-1,We really can t understand how hard it can be to complete our order Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n it s so frustrating 
-1,It was terrible took forever Only giving stars because the McMuffin was good 
-1,I didn t get much sugar for my coffee all milk and day getting served my Burger not my Burger my sausage mcmuffin didn t give it to me in the morning They got me for some money not a pleasant place to go when you hungry you want your food
-1,Never once have I gotten my coffee done right Cream in sugar out I got cream in my bag It was cream in I got no sugar Crazy
-1,Not to thrilled with this one anymore used to love it when it was the world biggest McDonalds Now it s like the others except for a few items on the menu Plus they got rid of the life size Ronald McDonald 
-1,Burger was greasy and the fries tasted like the oil needed changed
-1,Food it s okay however the customer service is terrible The few times I visited here the staff was rude and unprofessional 
-1,Too long waiting lines to get a very bad customer service Food is ok 
-1,Having kiosks instead of human cashier really a bad idea not fan of it Taking my business to a different place were greetings and thank you is the most important thing 
-1,Food was very good but quite a lot was missing from the order when we got home 
-1,Let s put it this way you better check your bag of food before leave They can barely understand English let alone get your order right 
-1,Food is always wrong
-1,They can not get any order right My order took remakes and finally I had to go in to the restaurant after placing my original order in the drive thru 
-1,I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food 
-1,Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds I ve been to for service
-1,Usally the location I visit is on the money both with over allservice and cleanses how ever this particular day the place was a total mess and service was horrible when it should not have been because it wasn t busy 
-1,Ordered double fish fillet sandwiches and got double and single Order must be checked and double checked for Togo I m not coming back to change the order after few miles 
-1,They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins
-1,The good thing is that is open They do not have enough personnel Food was just okay help us survive till the next morning 
-1,Standard food Fast service Cash only at night More expensive than other McDs 
-1,The only thing worse than the service was the food My wife s Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray 
-1,This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said yes horrible place will not recommend it
-1,Curbside is a joke Waited for mins should just go through the drive thru 
-1,Always a long wait today it took min in drive through most times around min but like their ice tea so but up with it
-1,Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they weren t remorseful for messing up my order at all
-1,FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE The service slow and unfriendly 
-1,Dirty unkind too long waiting time too high work load with minimum of employees
-1,Waited on line for mins just to place the order 
-1,Horrible service Looked like they didn 
-1,Stay away from this McDonald s seriously Worst service I 
-1,The people working here are not friendly Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total 
-1,Somehow they forgot to give us our order no big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize
-1,Food was cold Service could of been better
-1,Weird credit card layout tea was hot of a cup filled up and bland would skip this McDonald 
-1,Waited minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken
-1,I was there to separate times one time I paid over more than the second time and got the exact same thing
-1,Drive thru takes forever and orders are never right the inside with the new send order plus counter orders it s mobbed and confusing
-1,Might be I expect more from it But in comparison to the EU McDonald s the food is poor Drive through is a nightmare 
-1,Slow Haven t tried the food yet since I am min minute of waiting for my FAST food
-1,Sooo slow and got my order completely wrong Didn t seem to care 
-1,The food was hot I m just not a fan of McDonald s but two children enjoyed it
-1,Closed early and drive thru takes forever
-1,Need to update breakfast app menu and add back the souther style chicken biscuit
-1,It smell and it was dirty The worker were very pleasant
-1,They forgot the top bun on one sandwich Everything else wasn t much better Thrown together and awful 
-1,Took too long to complete order dirty floor overall impression of a badly run McDonalds a rarity 
-1,Service slow food cold and dry Had to queue back up to get a cup 
-1,I tried to buy a burger for a homeless lady and the manager told me no She then approached the homeless lady and told her to leave 
-1,Forgets food often longer wait time than some coasters in town Ran out of diet coke 
-1,Food was the same but this was a half hour wait for food Clearly this franchise was not up for a noon rush hour 
-1,They were extremely slow 
-1,The service in every Mcdonalds is doing worst with the time 
-1,When you are starving and nothing else in sight for the pocket change you have well that s why i go to McDonalds 
-1,Had a weird terrible unusual experience Went tonight about pm Only cars in front of me Ordered using my mobile app which I love it Ordered a mc chicken and guess what It came with NO CHICkEN And enough mayo to make two more Enjoy the picture 
-1,They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile It s horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant NOT GOOD for the business at all especially when your a regular This needs attention Immediately to earn the people s business 
-1,Cold fries Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn t melted The m ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter Then subpar at best 
-1,Bad service that don t give me what you order
-1,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service I am not sure if it s because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying Never has my sauce order been correct Never Even when I pay for it Even when I ask and confirm at the window It s awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag 
-1,Ok so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets I personally prefer the Wendy s spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting The McDonald s Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat But mine were extremely dry and hard one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting I can say I tried them but I was not impressed 
-1,food is typically put together well however curbside is a minimum of minutes once you pull up Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their food might as well go through the drive thru
-1,Unfortunately today while waiting in line pulled to the side not in the drive through lane my frappe was given to the person behind me She graciously didn t take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it I waited mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back I was very confused by this especially in Covid times I requested a different drink no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this 
-1,The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare We have coupons with the McDonald s app The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them because she was tired of having to ring then up My wife and I went to the restaurant today and she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all I m going to try and avoid this McDonald s in the near future 
-1,Slow af I don 
-1,Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day
-1,I ve been going to this location most of my life since it s not far from my home So I ve seen this McDonald s go through a lot of changes The employees here generally have decent attitudes there are a few that tend to be rude The store is also dirty a lot of the time It s a very busy location and maybe it s from having a lot of foot traffic but the floor is usually dirty the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky the ketchup area will be out of ketchup and or there will be ketchup all over the place too The tables tend to be dirty too you usually have to clean off your own table Also they have those light up tables that kids like and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there and they won t be eating and they ll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours And mind you these tables seat about and there will be one homeless person sitting there My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights and I ll have to tell him he can t because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table is camping there The employees don t seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours but buying anything Sometimes they ll even be sleeping at the table The kid s play area is also really crappy They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace They have of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly or at all When I was a kid they had a huge playplace which they took out when they remodeled the store It even had N s at one point along with the playplace But they took it all out and replaced it with a sitting place instead of a playplace It s really awful So all in all this McDonald s is dirty has a lot of homeless people that practically live there and isn t really kid friendly The food is okay as long as it s hot food I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong and the employees are generally friendly but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster meaning that you can tell they don t want to be there This location needs a lot of work And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there There hasn t been a single time I ve gone there that there wasn t at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself The table is by the front counter too and you can often times smell the homeless person that s sitting there the whole time you re waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks It is not kid friendly at all at this store With the store being in a nicer part of town you d expect quite a bit more cleanliness 
-1,I ve had good and bad experiences here Haven t had ti
-1,Ordered fillet o fish sandwiches after not having McDonald s for months ordered Xtra cheese got extra tarter instead Had it remade got no tarter no extra cheese again This is why ppl are mad you make such a high wage 
-1,The food was at McDonald s standards But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average Garbage cans overflowing Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasn t draining Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher You couldn t even set your cups down to fill them up 
-1,Pretty much the definition of meh and ok service Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful She had the worst I don t care kind of attitude Worst yet I believe she was the shift last or manager Either way if you don t care for the customer service the food is usually on par 
-1,It s pm line is SUPER LONG Waited a quite of bit of time just to order So be prepared Food was hot and fresh piece nugget meal 
-1,Get a veggie burger already God 
-1,Everything Very good but I ask for fresh fries and the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries and I said no fresh fries are fried in the moment they should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the moment because the customer is very important for us and period 
-1,It took us mins to get to order and get our drinks So slow very disappointing 
-1,Drive thru is not what it use to be They take far to long to be fast food because I thought it suppose to be seconds And half the time they mess up my order 
-1,This McDonald s chicken sandwich tasted like they changed the cooking oil once a year nasty Plus they always forget something by th
-1,Bummed The girl behind the counter was so helpful Pretty upsetting that ALL of the sandwiches in my order were wrong Yay my fries were right 
-1,The food is ok The price is ok If you go through the drive through they always make you pull forward because your food isn t ready yet 
-1,Very slow Drive thru line was wrapped around the building so I went in to order Took minutes to get a cheeseburger and fries 
-1,The morning crew is professional to they are a stellar group but the midnight shift is horrible food is cold desserts we re squashed and when I showed them the muffins she said that s how they came out 
-1,Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly
-1,They seemed like they gave me old food and the fries was to hard and the buns as well
-1,Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets 
-1,Nice employees but waited min for cold food
-1,McD s needs to stop messing with the sodas 
-1,Lost my order while the place was almost empty Chicken tenders were overcooked 
-1,They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never fresh but it s a standard place 
-1,I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was tough and undercooked I do not recommend 
-1,As has been for the last year slow slow service Went inside this time no better 
-1,Dirty slow inefficient They now bring your food to your table They forgot me So my food was colder than usual 
-1,Pictures are misleading No way does that chicken sandwich is so big liar liar pants on fire 
-1,Well don t ask them for a cup of ice you might be lucky to get six cubes
-1,Wrong orders watch what they give you double order lanes mean double mistakes
-1,It s ok the service stinks took too long
-1,That s all you get Service is mediocre 
-1,Customer service pm is awful on morning regularly personnel is better

-1,didnt give it star because the food was good but around days ago i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonald s app code to get the points i ordered something that was dollars in total and they charged me dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonald s app code to another car order my card is linked to the app and I ended up paying for their food i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said yeah I think that car is using my code the guy just said is your lucky day go to the next window It was late at night so I didn t give it much thought because I didn t know just by giving your code you can get charged but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice Tried calling but they didn t solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review
-1, adults ww children breakfast meals Had to go back to service counter times no eggs in meal Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat No apologies were given 
-1,Went through the drive thru and had a pre order They rushed us through they were busy then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong Not even worth going back for It s happened multiple times at this location 
-1,It was a clean and convenient location but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard no pickles no onions We received a fully loaded quarter pounder AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food She made no effort to offer the food She made us get it where she was McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there 
-1,They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate They are not very intuitive at all My order took three times as long to be brought out Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered fish sandwich and something else Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back 
-1,Atmosphere is cool and unique Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks The wait time was forever service was definitely slow But it was also Easter and spring break weekend But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra minutes for our fries and milkshakes That was weird and frustrating 
-1,The kids wanted it the kids loved it they had nuggets and fries it s McDonald s the service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive but you can t complain well it s like say your order and here s your meal lol but it s McDonald s
-1,Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible no one is taken the in house orders only drive thru is being taken care of I ve been standing here for minutes until I got to put in my order not a word said to me about the wait only of the desserts have labels Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken After receiving my order McDonald s employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen One customer said she didn t know how to use it so she was told by the McDonald s employee to continue to wait I finally got my order after minutes after coming in through the door 
-1,This morning went through the drive thru for my breakfast Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin Paid and advanced to the next window Here is where things went wrong The blue shirt manager last name begin with an A on duty Had a serious attitude She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee She said the there is no coffee on the order I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP Which is her job Her Words loud and clear FOR GOD SAKE I know I only spent a few dollars but IT don t justify getting attitude because this is your job I ask for a refund 
-1,I ve never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway Father s Day drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for mins This one has two separate planes to order The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles when paying we were barely acknowledged but the worse was to come When at the next window to get our food the person did not even look at me literally just handed a bag out the window then handed the drink out the same way partially angled down towards me Better yet check out the new crispy chicken deluxe 
-1,I ordered my food for pick up and when I walked into the restaurant it was cluttered with guests meandering about which I understood the behavior after MY minute wait that was AFTER I waited minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee So frustrating staffing seemed adequate just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager 
-1,Dine In is NOT available I went with family but we had to sit outside This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables 
-1,Customer service needs some serious work MOBILE APP was the first words out the the drive thru cashier s mouth not even a Welcome to McDonald s And the Egg McMuffin bread was hard Not a good experience 
-1,Typical mcdonalds I guess The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross Should of been tossed out entirely
-1,They messed my order up times They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw They have nasty attitudes You have to use the kiosk to place your order There is no more service with a smile An update I now have food poisoning form the raw undercooked chicken I was served yesterday Don t eat here I will never come back here ever again My reviews have been see by over people 
-1,Disappointing for the largest McDonald s Most menu s items were unavailable when we came in Service is subpar Kids had fun in hame rooms 
-1,They took minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldn t take that long and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold I m wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better but with most options out of stock I can t recommend going
-1,Could only order from kiosk Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English
-1,We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on idrive We were told that we could not eat there but way we were told was very rude 
-1,MacDonalds use to be a fast and friendly palace to order food what a disappointing restaurant with service and attitude 
-1,Granted we at a busy time of the evening SeaWorld was getting ready to close but the lobby to thus McDonald s was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours The drive thru was open but it was exceedingly slow The service was poor and the products we ordered were sub par even for McDonald s standards which is saying something We ended up just throwing some of it away I typically do not leave negative reviews I am hoping that they were just short staffed the night we went 
-1,This is easily the worst McDonalds experience I ve had Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a dirty chaotic nightmare Staff are totally disorganised and management seems non existent Only getting stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the counter it was piping hot and pretty delicious 
-1,This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I don 
-1,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late s bring the food out She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in No offense she was a sweet heart just worried 
-1,Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured bucket of salt on them This is not the first time I ve encountered cold overly salted food
-1,Too crowded inside and in the drive thru Did not get a chance to eat there Looks nice though 
-1,When I first pulled up to get breakfast at am the man told me to come back in mins I said what is this You mean I can t order food right now Yall start breakfast from am and go until am He said ok you can order but food won t be ready for at least min What was weird is soon as I ordered my food was already ready This particular McDonald s is way to busy and big to be pulling slack workers like that The guy seemed like he just didn t want to help 
-1,This particular McDonald s was incredibly slow My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they didn t put the pickles on it Overall it took over minutes in the drive through to get my food Not a great showing from a place that is not expected to be great 
-1,Was so excited for my first time coming to the big McDonald s because I was told you could order special menu items First disappointment Second not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasn t even working for over mins a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee that was half melted Very disappointing Will NEVER go back The employees were all chi
-1,Line for drive thru was slow and when we got up to order literally a third of the menu said that it was not in stock Be back soon We ended up not ordering 
-1,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders There was a giant mob waiting at the register s for their orders Be smarter with your manning 
-1,Largest and slowest in the world Took minutes from when I drove up till I left Took minutes to get my food after I paid Also I did not get a good morning or anything except The cost of my food Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there All for sausage biscuits and a coffee 
-1,I would give stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and star for the sausage burritos The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside It s been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonald s has definitely gone downhill Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money 
-1,Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because cars had passed on my right while i was waiting Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another more min I have now been waiting min for my items If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait I would not have felt forgotten at the window 
-1,Service is slow and painful lost McDouble Bundle option on menu for budget minded customers Still giving it stars because employees aren t paid enough to say Have a Good Day when you getting order at pick up window Change my mind next time I drive through and you ll get more stars Like what you see Just say OYE The Blond One 
-1,Ordered curbside The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take minutes and he couldn t cancel it He said he can substitute for cookies minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie Frustrating Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct
-1,Inconsistency on preparing my daily French vanilla latte Some times perfect sometimes bitter sometimes similar to the much less expensive regular black Also very inconsistent on getting special orders correct Very friendly crew 
-1,There s only way to describe my experience Have you ever gone in to a daycare and shook a basket full of babies well I haven t but I could imagine what it sounds like and that s how it sounded when I walked in the doors I didn t order anything and the employees were on there phones anyways So 
-1,The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about minutes before they could even take an order I m a local and I wouldn t ever go back to this location again Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area Also clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English This is difficult if you re trying to ask anything of the clerk Would not recommend 
-1,Sorely disappointed Outlets in every wall and not a single one working The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked so kudos to him Place was clean enough I guess 
-1,On Saturday at am drive through is moving at to minutes per car which works out to about to minutes to get your food from when order was placed Also only use lane and you will go faster 
-1,We were not impressed with this location They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drive through We made it inside but that wasn t much better The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk 
-1,All that technology and they can t remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens 
-1,I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries I even heard them making comments about the free coupon Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times I stopped by times in one week and had an issue each time The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the stars instead of 
-1,Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on at around pm The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda Great Management Skills 
-1,Found the drive through staff to be rude on a regular basis over the course of several visits If you can go a few miles down the road the Sand Lake location on I drive is much better 
-1,Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about mins start to finish For being a fast food they are super slow They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job My French fries were cold One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people 
-1,The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok She then gave me a piece nugget instead of I don t know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully Usually go to this location at least times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location
-1,You wouldn t expect it but it s not as good as it is in europe not to mention if you ll go there really hungry by the time they ll serve you you ll starve 
-1,Don t know why but ever since the rebuild of this site the burgers are unbearable Never juicy dry and unfavorable as can be From the little burgers to the quarter pounder it s the same Doesn t even taste like meat anymore They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months but we ll over a year now and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard What happened 
-1,Wrong order through the drive thru Doesnt surprise me any more with this location Glad I m not allergic to the items I requested to be removed 
-1,Often very slow bc of the flood of people Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy If you use the mobile app stick to drive thru I waited minutes for curbside pick up and minutes in lobby I recommend getting back in your car and going to Chick fil A You ll be there and back with your food before anything hap
-1,Super slow to get food It appears drive thru got all the attention minutes to get food is too long Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price
-1,I would rate it a star but people would not take my review seriously I visited this restaurant last night It was very clean including the bathroom At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register This wasn t possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk they had to get a receipt and pay at the register I left minutes later and went to Wendy s when the line had barely moved 
-1,I ve had one really positive experience at this McDonald s and one really negative First time they were super fa
-1,New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a human and I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk very frustrating Also the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasn t broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike 
-1,Not Brother bringing food food to table long wait and don 
-1,The employee s are nice location is always dirty Tables have to be clean more often The food quality has gotten better 
-1,Order is wrong everytime i have went or missing items 
-1,This is not the worlds biggest McDonald 
-1,Ordered the Quarter pounders deluxe with cheese no pickle and one with no onion They both had no lettuce and tomato on them I call them about it and they were glad to replace them I go back and mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them nevergetitright McDonalds
-1,extremely busy highly understaffed waited hr in drive thru last resort for my food this is not fast food 
-1,Past recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing Not an example of fast food 
-1,It has been min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them 
-1,Pretty cool but didn t drive a hour drive to for the cashier to catch a attitude wi
-1,Wait for my order over minutes drive thru Deluxe with extra onions Fries where soggy Had to go back inside to get fresh fries Looked under staffed
-1,The service was awful and rude They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing 
-1,Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the employee s table Noisy and confused environment Not for business people Has a minute time limit on Internet 
-1,Quite literally one of the worst McDonald s ever Staff is incompetent unfriendly and doesn t get the order right or the food is OLD As the manager of a room resort I advise all of my guests to detour this location 
-1,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers weren t working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma 
-1,The nuggets from this location were the WORST I ve ever had Unfortunately I didn t taste them until I d gotten back to my room otherwise I d definitely have asked for my money back 
-1,Sloooooow service PM and just got a cheeseburger small fries from drive thru because I was late for a meeting Took minutes for this simple order Really for a burger fries 
-1,Got nuggets and fries Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries Got no barbeque or ketchup good thing we went to the big mcdonalds enjoying dry nuggets now At least the food was hot 
-1,Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly staff 
-1,In almost all McDonald s I have been going have self order post The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right No help you need to l look ace the order again 
-1,Fries were very cold children s burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service wasn t terrible but food put out was 
-1,Slow service and attendents don t acknowledge customers I ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat but it was slow
-1,They can t handle a lot of customer Waited minutes for my order outside
-1,So they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines Ugh Place smells like disinfectant and bleach charges tourist prices 
-1,THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Definitely not coming back 
-1,Service was very slow Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited minutes for their orders
-1,Was under staffed long wait order was gotten wrong
-1,All self ordering machines food took forever to come out drink machine didn t work
-1,No vegeterian options
-1,Came for dine in service apparently last one of the night since I got locked in food was you know McDonald s the terrible management is quite apparent at this place if there is another option do not come here
-1,Sucked biscuits were old and hard not going back
-1,Adopting the kiosks eliminated any chance for interaction with a person The lack of counter and lobby staff makes for a customers helping customers Several people gave up on kiosks and left Expecting robots in the kitchen next time The lobby and bathrooms are clean 
-1,Prices high and mcgriddle sandwich fit in palm of hand Not worth money 
-1,The food was correct and warm but minutes in the drive through was not expected 
-1,My Nuggets Came Back Covered In Mustard When I Said I wanted mayonais the manaigs they tried giving me was disguting when i ate it and trhen the mustard got on my arm
-1,No ice cream machines again Always broken and right next to many hot theme parks where people want ice cream with lunch 
-1,Trash cans outside were over filled and garbage was all over the floor At least the fries were hot 
-1,Customer service was just poor and uninviting Didn t really eat since just getting a drink but for a place next to hospitality centric services I was surprised 
-1,Short of help and check your bag for accuracy 
-1,Food is typical for McDonald s I decided to eat in but alarms were loud and constant the entire time I was there Several people working and ignoring the various buzzers and chimes This will keep me from returning 
-1,The manager is not professional If you want to eat in the restaurant you must do it outside in the heat you cannot eat inside the restaurant
-1,Waited at the table for an egg McMuffin meal for min It must be quicker if you order to go Sucks
-1,For the quality of food that McDonald s has it amazes me the cost of it 
-1,Very very slow Nice looking McDonald s but I won t go back to this one 
-1,Computers were not working cash only a complete mess Cashiers do not know how to operate without them 
-1,Inconsistent customer service Nothing really positive to report 
-1,They were slow and unprepared unfortunately since this location is in a hotel district 
-1,Service not what it should be Too slow and the quality keeps dropping 
-1,One of the largest McDonald s in the world as it is GI NORMOUS The food is hit or miss though especially if you go through the drive thru 
-1,Fast food is called such because you should get it fast completely unacceptable to wait almost minutes for BREAKFAST
-1,The customer service is not really good Need more Organized

-1,Dawg hurry tf up mannn I 
-1,Seriously the slowest mcd I ve ever been to 
-1,Extremely slow Food wrong Did not feel like going back in to fix it 
-1,No idea why they completely neglected the dining room trash cans overflowing trays of trash everywhere and all the condiments napkins etc empty 
-1,Made a special request on my order I had to repeat it three times because a staff member ignored it 
-1,Drive thru was so slow and no sauce given when asked and displayed on the screen
-1,One step slower in service they would go backwards By the time you get your food it s already cold 
-1,Orders senior coffee at the new kiosk and it charges you more for using it Go directly to the cashier 
-1,They are NOT open hrs despite what it says

-1,When this McDonald s first opened OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme The animatronics made noise and moved The service WAS excellent But now it looks like a tourist trap Some days you ll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain it s quality that it had As far as the food goes Well it s McDonald s same as any other 
-1,They where not friendly The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt Got to the nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot Waited at least mins before anyone came out to our car Asked what we ordered and for our receipt which we didnt have Finally brought our food out and burgers where wrong 
-1,Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ish and the location although you d think is convenient after visiting the zoo It s a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location 
-1,Awful experience It was and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets I order my tea in the drive through line The line was pretty long When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes said they could only take cash I said what I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word I said for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea She looked strange and I said please let me speak to your manager She spoke to someone and the manager said no and wouldn t come to the window AWFUL 
-1,Always something with this location Either system down only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights
-1,Same ol ready in minutes food Idk how they do it But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave Great Job Mickey D s
-1,Well it might have been ok if I was not rushing but I still stayed for my items For this to be McDonald s they should know that it s busier during certain hours then others there were soo many ppl in line the average person would have turn right back around n walked out 
-1,The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins Even after you ve ask Then soon as you drive away You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to 
-1,Burgers are always flat Good for on the road food I sure do miss the dollar menus tho And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets humm
-1,Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still can t receive it what s the point of leaving a note if no one reads it I ve order different times and never fail to disappoint me
-1,My family and I get to this McDonald s we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no The Wi Fi here is not even strong enough I could not complete my homework Bummed out Not the best as usual 
-1,The customer service is just not what it used to be There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help I ended up payimg for someone elses order At st i thought it was more but it was cents less I m glad i only go there for drinks 
-1,Today June at aka my order was taking in drive thru I ask for Double chesse burger with no oins and no pickles with large sweet tea extra ice add lemon So my drink had no extra ice or lemon and frys I drive home to eat my food which I stay mints away from store it by my school I get hone to open my bag to have only receive Hot Spicey and no Fry s which was not my order and young lady at both windows ready my order back I have called the store times to speak with manager and nobody has pick up the phone
-1,I like that it is animal theme and has a playground but the cashiers are rude and they can t get your order right so they get mad when you tell them you are missing something Also they are dirty

-1,Almost everything I order was wrong I order a Sunday with chocolate syrup and they brought me caramel I also order and paid extra for bbq sauce and they didn t put any the food was also cold Worst restaurant 
-1,Warning Check your order every time you come to this location Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered Don t let them tell you
-1,Cant hate on the workers its Mcdonalds just dont go to this location And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next hours
-1,They won t mess up your order but you will sit in the drive through for at least minutes before you get to order and then wait another minutes to get your food Overall unless it s your only option you should drive on to a better run McDonalds 
-1,I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers The worst part is that one of the managers a young latino kid was engaged in of these conversations I asked the manager why he wasn t controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed 
-1,Went late one night to the drive thru and was told they were closed I pulled forward and someone was paying for their meal I thought this was a location 
-1,Used drive thru at am finally got my food at am They have two lanes for offering and only one window to dispatch food for those plus the uber drivers on foot at the window waiting for their orders Food was kind of cold fries and breaded chicken tasted like burned oil and on top of that they didn t put any mayonnaise or ketchup for the fries These big chains have no quality control It s actually sad when you compare the food from the picture to what you really get 
-1,Slow service manager working register and takeout not enough help 
-1,Ordered piece nuggets and they were not fresh and were very hard like they were overcooked Also gave me the wrong sauce 
-1,Didn

-1,Such slow service in the drive thru every single time I am here I made my order mins a go and I still haven 
-1,To go order without napkins no sauces asked BBQ for the nuggets Diet Coke was a mix of flavors 
-1,Poor service I had a nugget medium fries a m caramel frappe and medium mocha frappe they charged me for a small mocha and salad dressing she charged me the difference but they almost gave me a small I had to ask why they charged me that also they neglect to let you know they dont have caramel or chocolate and when I asked they just told me there isn t any with attitude
-1,Didn t understerstand or couldn t understand simple English Drinks moslty ice diluting flavor Ask for no ice and get a cup of ice separate 
-1,Very slow employee take forever to get you order Im not recommended to any body this place
-1,Kind person that cant manage to get an order right times I had to come back to get the order redone Kind cashier everything else about this place sucks 
-1,What s up with this Lady taking Hours every morning to clean just the men s restroom this is every morning and don t even ask her to let you in just to wash hands she ll send you to ypur house or women s restroom

-1,Saw the manager come out the back picking his nose straight up digging for gold in that thing then start serving people with no gloves CmonSon
-1,Poor attention from the team casher and manager discrimination against homeless person that wanted to buy food Not a recommended place to visit 
-1,Thru the years I have seen how the people working in this particular mcDonald s changed for the worse

-1,I ALWAYSSSS ask for my muffins WELL TOASTED They understand BURNTTTTT 
-1,Dirty rude workers food was cold

-1,Average
-1,It s McDonald s 
-1,I don t like it very much the breads are not like the ones we used to eat at McDonald s also almost all of them only speak English and sometimes it s hard to communicate
-1,To get out of the way it goes well but the attention is unfriendly dirty bathrooms Average food to a MCD 
-1,Dirty place noisy employees and they took the order wrong
-1,Of all the stores of the Macdonals chain that I have visited this is the slowest and without customer service The lady that they must know that employee by employee number was very abusive with her way of attending she was very closed in the explanation in the offer that she wanted she argued that it is not her problem to explain but only to place orders in mockery that she did not want order would cancel the order he fought because his service is like that as if he was going to give me the order as a gift 
-1,The food is good but the service is bad nobody pays attention to you
-1,A rather dirty place the toilets were filthy We waited more than min to be served fast food Far from being the best McDonald s we ve had 
-1,Virtually the entire store was uncleaned the disgusting bathrooms the uncleaned tables the floor with the rest of the food the super slow service lack of staff much to be desired
-1,Rare bustling place to eat in this part of Bay Side on Byscayne Boulevard Lack of better between skyscrapers 
-1,The place looks impressive but it is not what it seems and it is not very high quality 
-1,Zero hygiene
-1,Bad service and bad taste Wouldn t go back there 
-1,It closed at p m and they wouldn t let us in incredible by force and with the help of people who complained while inside we were able to enter badly
-1,I went at am on Sunday and it was closed A lie
-1,Good evening Completely disorganized staff speaking very loudly in Haitian Creole The wait was very long 
-1,no power the cardboard straws
-1,This rains on the wet very bad attention and they take too long 
-1,The service is horrible they want to take the order however they want
-1,The fries were old and cold 
1,I m not really a huge fan of fast food but I have teenage daughter s who enjoy McDs The staff here is always friendly and ALWAYS get their orders correct By far one of the best McDs I have ever been to I always enjoy and appreciate quality service from quality people and you ll definitely find it here At least from the evening crew Haven t been here during the day My girls joke that I go here so often to get them food that the staff is going to end up knowing me and having their order ready to go Lmao Great people and excellent service 
1,The line wS extremely big and was moving very slowly plus they were out of apple pies and strawberry cream pies but they gave me substitute cinnabun the staff was very apologetic for being slow they were out of pies but it was middle of the night and they were extremely under staffed 
1,The staff seems to always be different which makes ordering sometimes a little difficult because they are in a state of perpetual learning which can also lead to waiting a bit longer but the lobby is always clean as well as the bathrooms
1,With all the new upgrades everything looks great and clean great staff
1,Good quick drive through service Was a long line but went very quickly 
1,I go here all the time Great staff NVR get my food wrong it s just always a line wrapped around lol that s why they ain t stars Most def customer service is better then the food but hey I just go for my kids because they love it so why not Good customer service guys Makes all the difference
1,OPEN HRS all the darn time If there are hours in every day and then days in a week then that means this place is open eleventeen million hours a year I dont even know how they find people to work here I mean how do they shower or brush their teeth or change clothes if they are always there I think I may have an idea they are robots Or clones like this example that s Dolly the sheep she s pretty hot NGL 
1,It was late order was wrong person taking order needs to slow down 
1,Service is slow but I get all of my items with no errors and it s a bit smaller than most locations Overall it s a good place to grab a quick bite near Lake Creek 
1,Manager waited on me He went out of his way to make me a satisfied customer Great customer service 
1,I would have given stars the evening manager is the nicest person I have seen and is definitely in charge of training her crew with constantly new help in spite of this everytime I have to return an order she goes back to the kitchen and patiently disassembles the sandwich and explains the proper way to make the sandwich in a spirit of education and with a cherry disposition You can tell the children she works with respect her and look up to her and yes they might get things confused occasionally but I will continue to go there out of stars
1,The staff is very kind and the food is usually prepared in a timely manner for this reason it sone of my preferred location s However the drive thru line can sometimes be an inconvenience as it can get very long and at times even block entrances 
1,Mcdonalds is great but they really need to hire people who understand both english and spanish and not just spanish speakers trying to take english orders The people are really nice but be smarter about who you put in the drive thru and lobby to take orders 
1,Food was good atmosphere was ok restaurant was clean Only thing from making it a I almost ate it on the floor Wet sign was present but it was beyond slick Otherwise good quick place to grab a bite 
1,EDIT Recently this McDonald s had been improving a lot especial when compared to other McDonald s in the area maybe the one on North part of W Parmer but not really fair comparison I mean That one has a god damn waterfall Keep up the good work Star OLD They took out all the power outlets and a table was just left broken covered with caution tape Always understaffed and you can tell the owners are sucking this place for every penny without putting anything back in Gives family owned McDonald s a bad name 
1,Look it is good food for the money It is fast food people but I will rather go to McDonald s than all the other fast food burger places Fries are off the chain everytime honestly Craving one as we speak 
1,Live nearby and this is our choice McDonald s compared to others in close distance I gotta say though that the last order of fries I got really were so yucky I chewed on and didnt eat the rest They tasted over cooked or double cooked Something made them rubbery and inedible to me 
1,This store has a friendly smiling staff It is clean And most of the time the orders are correct and when they aren t the management makes it right Convenient easy quick 
1,As part of Lake Creek Festival Mall review McDonald s is featured as a member of the Mall and as Contributing Member of Our Anderson Mill Community Peace 
1,There service was good but don t order a med water they charge I ask and she said anything bigger than a small they do charge well all they had to do is tell me before I pay and give me a choice 
1,Go everyday for my morning breakfast before work Staff is nice and if I ever had a error with my to go order the manager has made it right 
1,Still the best unhealthy cheapest breakfast in town The coffee is a steal And yes we all deserve a break every once in a while

1,Not worth the effort to get in and out of construction to wait for old food Only went there twice The food is never fresh Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered nuggets and fries and a milkshake They didn t give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said do whatever and walked away I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake She said they ll bring it Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly well do you have a receipt clearly not Eventually they brought out the shake but fries were old and cold and the shake was melted 
1,Very clean and polite people here They did mix up my pie order but was refunded 
1,Haven t ate McDonald s in years got a breakfast sandwich and I must say thanks for switching the egg and the crispy bacon they listened to me and did what I wanted I m impressed 
1,The most recent time was great Fries were hot n crispy I gave stars instead of because I m still thinking about the Time before last the fries were cold right out the gate 
1,Quick bit fare price come by
1,Nice clean and friendly The cashier was knowledgeable and patient especially when people could not make up their minds on their food choices The food seems better than most McDonald s but not by much 
1,This is our hometown MCdonalds and between the wife grandchildren and I we are here twice a week Like review I did on the Hamlin MCDonalds I call this the older style and it s been ainted over the years and they removed the small playyard it had People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didn t get used over months of the year There is ample seating but I ve seen more with more seating but we ve never been without finding a seat Everything is pretty clean and in good order Walk in orders are accurate and fast Drive in is fast and about times out of they will have it exact Some times they get it wrong but like we say nobody s perfect Since it s right on Rt it s easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on then sometimes it s hard to pull out because there s KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so it s a busy little area in Brodheadsville Overall it s a nice facility 
1,Wind Gap PA location was surprisingly better during COVID because with the interior closed the drive up was fast and serving fresh food The streamlined way allows serving just the drive up and so the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area Probably saves on staff hours Just crave those FRIES once in awhile 
1,Got the peice mc chicken nuggets and a large fry The nuggets we re fine but the Fry s we re stale and that made me sad The fries can be the best part of the meal I know that I could have and should have returned them But I didn t 
1,Always consistantly good food at a good price I like the breakfast choices The fries are the best of any fast food restaurant period I ve read articles how they selectively choose and then sign contracts with potato farmers to insure the quality and taste is maintained throught all the locations I wish they would deep fry the apple pies as they did years ago they were the best when fried Good service always have the food choices in stock clean seating area kitchen and bathrooms Enjoy

1,Our visit was on Friday There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft Hamilton Parkway Katherine the Manager and her staff Chris promptly offered help and solutions to my family s needs The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table particularly for the disabled Another concern was the price of the food Though there were dollar options available the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high A median income family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month if that often The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris He is a credit to the McDonalds company 
1,I don t know why they every night whatever they like to close the dining room No time to control it But on the door have a sign showed dinning room open hours And still using the garbage can to block the door
1,My daughter and I had a very nice experience here Upon entering a worker directed us to the order kiosk and inputted the order for us Then had it delivered to our table Don 
1,Food are ok typically mc service are good but They don t allow scooter get in 
1,Been coming to this mcdees since when they had a hamburgler jail and a big yellow slide out in the open But lately they ve had a hard time getting orders right 
1,Here s the flag they currently fly June to honor our brothers and sisters who lost their lives defending us 
1,Mmmm to be honest they are pretty fast with their drive by orders I cannot complain but they run out of the special items and Frappuccinos pretty fast Overall food quality is pretty much always fresh 
1,Easy to pick up my mobile orders They have soda machines so you don t have to worry about specifying no ice in drinks They include napkins straw and lids Straws have either been paper or plastic They do not include ketchup packets so you have to ask counterstaff drinks is a perk that no other fast food restaurant has The dining room has plentiful tables and chairs too ranging from booths to high stools to couch like chairs Easy to get there by Q or Q Not very close to any subway stations 
1,Place was busy no chasier at the time Just had to order in the kiosk or through the app I ordered on my phone through the app and I got taken care of in a reasonable time People who ordered on the kiosk and couldn t pay by card had to wait for someone to collect the money at the cashier With all the chaos I want to say the team was handling it Download the app on your phone and service will be faster Also the app does offer deals and free stuff with purchase 
1,Best mcdonalds in the area but for some reason they charge a few cents more Not a big deal but just something I noticed The staff makes fries fresh forreal lol upon request Nuggs are Hit or miss But burgers are pretty good Not a fan of the chicken products from here but the other mcodnalds on th and has good chicken
1,The place seems cool actually isn t bad as other M
1,Pretty good About what you expect from a McDonald s 
1,Pretty average McDonald s the seating is nice the service is also quite fast The food is pretty average It does get crowded sometimes so I suggest that you go there knowing what you want so that it s a bit easier for the employees 
1,Fast and efficient service The food is always fresh
1,Seems like a new McDonald s my first time here Got my food really quick They have the high tech screen ordering and mobile ordering Very big parking lot and drive thru windows My food came out hot and tasted great I hate getting cold fries I was given fries right out of the fryer 
1,Newly renovated They have added extra drive thru lanes LOL I think we waited longer to get food The fish sandwich was good but fries tasted like yesterday s 
1,It was used to be one of very convenient McDonald s stores No dine in services and no restrooms make things difficult for everyone I can t imagine how every place is going to 
1,TLDR You can get the BTS meal here two sauces and special bag included Never thought I d be writing a review for a McDonald s yet here we are Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn t available in the U S Corporate missed opportunity Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations Fears were quelled as I saw other guests sitting outside and the elusive BTS paper bag going for on eBay was elusive no longer Utilized the self service machines to order quick and easy Medium and large sizes available opted for medium which was more than enough food in hindsight Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce but just a personal preference Total of the medium BTS meal was tax Food was nothing special just happy to support the boys As always please be kind to food service workers Borahae 
1,Good local fast food service located in the neighborhood at rd Avenue Kissena Boulevard People are always friendly whether you eat in or take out So pickup from sausage on a biscuit pancakes with or without sausage burgers apple pie coffee or fountain soda at times has special promotions nice variety menu They do have a kids room for parties Large parking lot or drive order menu board then drive up window and pay Opens early to late 
1,Place is spacious clean had parking and bathrooms But when I went they had no Automated teller machines and only one Human Cashier during a busy time of day Completely inadequate 
1,Food was the usual fare but the ordering process needs work Asks for Table Number but do not explain that you need to take a sign to ID your table 
1,Good place for a quick lunch or snacks They have so many things to choose 
1,They renovated this McDonald s and it s huge now It s still McDonald s but faster drive thru Still open and a good place to satisfy your McCravings
1,Value Taste Service Presentation of food Appearance of the establishment 
1,Everything was fine but once i ordered on app and chose drice thru to pick up The employee was really impatient and sighed 
1,Upgraded but you have to double check your order as they will not give you ketchup or sauces unless asked still they will forget
1,A couple of edp s in here but the staff was friendly Staff is out of control today manager yelling at everybody nothing is going right Amazing to see so many employees made it to work in this Blizzard today and seem happy Good job 
1,Food is always great but you have be careful with the drive through They ve forgotten things on my order a few times 
1,A nice place with good service Coffee is hot and fresh and better than Starbucks Get there early and it is a relaxing way to start the day McDonald s is classic American 
1,DO NOT GO NOW under renovation there s no drive thru either Other than that they 
1,Ordered via the app and received the food quickly Fast service clean and the food was fresh even though we went at peak lunchtime 
1,This day we tried the Mobil app love it but it needs to be where we don 
1,Just the average Mc Donalds nothing special has clean bathrooms and is near a lot of other stores to shop at A fun place to visit in general I guess 
1,Why would anyone hate McDonald s coffee is inexpensive oatmeal with fruits my favorite I have only eaten fish sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes my preference is whole grain bread however it is not on the menu
1,Very clean love the new burgers the the eating atmosphere But McDonald s and my diet is just a once a month affair Lol 
1,The usual McDonald s good drunk food Crowed in drive thru service still pretty quick Price went up a little not much still good deals
1,This place is very nice and clean Most of the staff members are very friendly and has smile on them most of the time Would repeat
1,It s not bad drive through wise besides the facr that they allow homeless people to stay there it has gotten better
1,Nice place a tad bit busy but you got to make sure your orders at done correctly
1,Is good because it has a play area for the kids However there are a lot stranger who might approach you to ask for money 
1,Sometimes they cant handles all orders But so far its good
1,Used the drive thru window pay window pick up Fast once you place your order 
1,Good service and quality but bad food making the cheese and ingredients fall out the burger a lot of times

1,accident with a UPS truck and Tesla About a week ago nearby Macy s th and th avenue have to be closed for hr
1,I gave it stars because this McDonald s is very clean staff are very nice respectful tends to ur needs if their is some They have a second fl Where the bathroom r clean also inspire the crowd I come in early because is quite if u need a place to work or homework Actually there is a third floor also very spacious 
1,Very nice and clean kiosk booths are user friendly for ordering and paying for your food Just watch out for folks soliciting you for any spare change And they be touchy Not cool 
1,It s an okay place If you need somewhere to take the weight of your feet this is a good place 
1,Well staffed on the weekend Clean and efficient service Food is prepped on nd floor and ride conveyor down to be bagged I don t like the idea of not being able to glimpse food preparation operation However service is good Food tastes as expected Standard nothing special Kind of small space Fine to satisfy immediate hunger 
1,Little but fast
1,I Rarely frequent McDonald s as a brand but your beautifully remodeled location diagonal from Penn Station is the ONLY place you can get ice coffee and a breakfast sandwich at in the morning The staff that was on the first time I went where pleaser and efficient The second time I went I had to use the kiosk which frustrated me I rather interact with humans A young lady from the back came out to help me place my order and I was an appreciative and satisfied customer that morning 
1,Although this particular McDonald s is located in the heart of Manhattan the service was very friendly just not very expeditious The food was consistent with McDonald s Fair so I guess it was okay overall I mean it s McDonald s you going to like it or you don t and I m sure most people that s reading this have at least visited one in the lifetime if not more and they re different depending on who you go to and what day but the food to be consistent if the food sucks everything about the experience sucks okay have a great day until my next one 
1,Not Stars just because of the homeless around that block But everything inside it s all good The food always good the wait time always good Never had a problem here the only annoying are the crazy aggresive homeless that sometimes go there Other homeless are calmed and just ask for food outside 
1,Good but too busy
1,Was nearby and felt like a good burger They had their two for fish fillet deal so I decided to try it out This location is usually busy but almost always has places to sit Pretty good perk also has a nice view on the nd floor The sandwiches were well made but I ve also gotten sub par burgers in the past stale and
1,NYC bedlam as usual but food was hot and good
1,Fast service food is good Usually busy around lunch time Modern looking with floors to sit and self ordering kiosks They sell pastries as well which I haven t seen in other McDonald s 
1,Fast service but the ordering machine should be fine tuned to be more user friendly There is one staff who is otherwise on standby to help guests with the machines Dining area is clean and nicely decorated Great views by the glass windows at the upper floors Free Wi Fi is pretty reliable 
1,Fast service food is good and modern looking automated ordering kiosks on the wall floors to sit down and eat and I was surprised how decently clean it was when my friends and I visited here Not sure if it is this clean on a daily basis however
1,The restaurant clean Covin precaution was recognized by management 
1,Speedy service but very rude employee she must have been frustrated but No need for that glad I never really have to go there again
1,American food in the midst of Chinatown Reasonable seating but prices were a bit high It s NYC you might say but it s just a hamburger I would say However several in our group noted that the burgers
1,food was good i was particularly impressed by the self order service where i can choose what i want pay and then just go to pickup almost like delivery in a way stars because the staff are a little rough 
1,Great coffee in the morning for only a buck any size anyway Love it the best coffee Food is scrumptious especially anything on the menu but for me the breakfast is my favorite 
1,I went on last Wednesday and the automatic machines didn t work for ordering inside The place was full too tight for people that were there eating Apart from this good and quick service 
1,Good fast food as expected I just don t like the fact the pickup panel is not used need to keep hearing the ladies calling your number 
1,McDonald s food is usually the same everywhere I go Yay fastfood I went to this one during the Big Apple Comic Con weekend They handled the con rush well Costumes and hungry cos players can be a struggle but the managers were right there with their employees making sure everything was ok A homeless dude was asking for money Kind of sucked but they got rid of him quickly though 
1,Fast foods fast food Always busy here but fast and they didn t mess up my order so I guess that s good 
1,Good spot to just grab a quick bite The lines vary depending on the time of day especially given the pandemic 
1,The employees where very kind n tge store was clean the whole experience was pleasant the one thing wrong was they didn t have the third floor open so limited space n someone left so we could sit down they should of had tge third floor open 
1,Clean restaurant Amiable staff The food should have been hotter 
1,I don t eat McDonald s but my grandson liked this place especially the upstairs dining area I was a little disappointed with the wait time but most of the employees were kind 
1,This is not intended to be fine dining 
1,City is busy and this McDonald s is no exception but the order was done Fast Got a table and was able to enjoy my meal 
1,I like the freedom over there Get your food and coffee sit and relax Nobody bothers Leave whenever you want It 
1,Quick service but grim interior Not their fault it is in Times Sq Still not an attractive location but fast
1,Nice location If you like McDonald s you ll appreciate the fast service and option to order via self order system 
1,Good and fast but have become expensive
1,Its McDonald s so u cant go too wrong But it was good and service was good
1,Ok place Expensive If you go there are tables upstairs

1,I asked chicken burger they gave chees burger but the taste was awesome 
1,Need to work on giving hot fries But overall ok
1,Its GOOD place but sometimes service is sliw due to lack of experience 
1,Just a very busy place service was fast
1,Fast Service but a littel rude some of the stafff 
1,Good day Clean undisturbed Good pleasant staff 
1,There is not much to say about a McDonald s Convenient location Open x

1,I always visit this place whenever I have to wait for the train Very good customer service I like McDonald s a very safe place
1,The best thing about it is its location but the quality of its food its appearance and taste and service I give it a 
1,This is a rather well decorated and pleasant McDonald s In addition to being fabulously located in the middle of the gigantic skyscrapers of Broadway this place is not excessively crowded which makes it even more pleasant And finally a fundamental and important detail these days there is Wifi So I recommend this place 
1,A little dirty
1,A traditional MC Do it s fast and it s good You can take a break and enjoy the Wi Fi 
1,We were only here for drinks for a large drink was a welcome price in expensive New York 
1,A little cleaning in the client room
1,Exactly the same as all MacDonald s They had a cheap menu of and dol I didn t like them because they gave me heartburn the times I ate 
1,For self help travel choosing fast food is the most convenient way to solve meals When you are in a foreign country you think it is unpalatable but it is actually quite delicious

1,Always McDonalds They are well organized here 
1,Good very quiet place to have breakfast near Penn Station
1,It was very quiet and clean Good place to have breakfast 
1,They treated me well and delivered what I requested the computers did not have clear options to place the order
1,It is mc but the space is very small In that city at rush hour you can t find where to sit

1,The attention is excellent wifi etc Like in your country Economic

1,Cleanest McDonald s I ve been to in awhile No major issues except I think my bun was molded they said i
1,Shamrock shake was delicious always a bit hectic in there but they get the work done
1,Probably the cleanest McDonald in the city It s partly due to the posted security at the front door to prevent transient homelessness to take over Also the competent day and night managers who motivated the food preparation team to perform optimally This place should be the exemplary MacDonald store that all the other macDonald stores in the city should learn from 
1,They got fast hands to make a sandwich from Seconds no wait in this day over crying good food hamburgers taste like McDonald s
1,Standard run of the mill McDonald s We only had a coffee and a hot chocolate But no problems
1,It s a good place to go and get a quick snack and drink 
1,Pretty busy and kind of dingy in lighting McDonalds Service is not as fast as you might like however the food is quite fresh 
1,The place seems very understaffed for the amount of traffic that s comes through this store so the registers are usually empty so order at the kiosk The food might take a bit also but it 
1,The Big Mac wasn t fresh but service was fast I would like to suggest everyone to download their McDonald s app They offer great deals rewards points to receive free food 
1,Mcdonald s food is Mcdonald s food notting to it I don t like the manager But the location is very cool and the music gives you a good feeling Again I just don t like the manager 
1,They had a very limited space but to make an agile experience they have two big touch screen menus to place your order faster than going to directly to the cashier line They only have one unisex restroom so if you are in a hurry be prepared mentally to wait Anyway I think you ll enjoy your meal if you take in consideration these things 
1,Very friendly staff looks clean service is great
1,NEW MANAGER NEW VIBE great experience The homeless shelter vibe is gone the place is clean the service is good Thanks for adding the security guard and the great new management Well that didn t last long The new manager apparently didn t last It s still better than it was before though 
1,Absolutely functional You can order fast and sure when I went I was sure that It would take lot of time but that didn t happen the food was cooked in just a few minutes and it
1,Pretty cool one 
1,You can sit and eat inside The quality of the food is always on point during Breakfast and lunch hours I have yet to visit during dinner hours 
1,Very quick service surprisingly easy to operate their self service kiosk Order was ready really fast I usually don t go to McDonalds but I was in a tight time crunch For a McDonald s restaurant it was not very busy I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York City Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the area 
1,This is a location which is great The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people Also the layout is a bit odd It narrows significantly in the middle of the store making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times 
1,Best for quick breakfast 
1,Great service and extremely quickly served Very friendly kind and professional staff Will most certainly visit again And yes the food in McDonald s is always satisfying An American Classic 
1,It s not a bad McDonald s by any stretch of the imagination but there are better in Manhattan It s fairly clean there s plenty of seating the food was made well There are none of those fancy new ordering kiosks and the bathrooms are dirty 
1,Better service than usual manager moved my order along He wanted my order number to ease the wait 
1,It was my first time visiting this location it was nice It was clean staff was helpful I would visit again if in the area 
1,Not bad manager is rude to customers n employees food was good kid at register was very nice
1,Taylor was absolutely amazing to me This was great experience after having bad ones at other locations Very happy Will come again 
1,Restaurant is a ghost town and I am thankful for it lots of non paying customers normally around Food is fresh and staff is very efficient 
1,crispy spicy chicken sandwich crispy spicy chicken sandwich crispy spicy chicken sandwich is all i have to say you must stop in and get it and mix it with a hamburger and you will have whats called a mcgangbang you will be glad that you did so and will never get anything else please stop and get a milkshake and fries with a stop in there 
1,Its McDonald s If you ve been to one you ve practically been to them all Service was nice enough around breakfast time food quality can be hit or miss do they even care about Google reviews 
1,Have to wait for a while before I
1,Meals and counter service have improved Open hours to a diverse crowd of locals tourists and visitors

1,The staff is not good Rude Didnt even heaitate to take my order I was trying the screen when The manager came and took another persons order and then i gone to him and had the order taken He was helpful and in mn my order was ready Had some beggars on premises asking for money Was not busy Had lots of free seats 
1,The service was excellent even at all hours very hard worker and very clean for the amount of traffic flow My experiences here have been memorable Keep up the amazing work McDonald s 
1,Got two Filet O Fish sandwiches Both were good as expected I ordered through the McDonald s app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code She instructed me to go to the first window There I was given the receipt thanked and told to go to the next window At the nd window I was told to go to a rd window to pickup the order The rd window is kind of funny since it seems like an afterthought Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right The employees were very friendly 
1,Fast and reliable McDonald s the McFlurry machine is always working which is a nice bonus The IPU boys can lick my butt 
1,Drive thru friendly and the request on how u want your food they comply kristy very friendly real customer service
1,Driving can be a bit awkward here with a sightly confusing entrance exit and with very limited parking that can get clogged when there are cars entering or leaving That said they ve consistently done a good job filling my orders and never given me any reason to complain in that regard 
1,Well no body tells you you have to order in the machines cause supposedly they take orders and the register but not body comes to get your order I wait and wait and wait for mint aproximily and no one get my order and did and the machine but the company had to understand no all the people can order like people use glasses and forget them old people don t know the technology or you don t bring your card to pay I know is easier but at least have to be one person to take your order on these cases Well is my respectfully opinion
1,Ive been here before and given them star due to slow processing of order been here again and it change so giving them star lets come back and check again next time 
1,Glad I walked in The drive thru line was ginormous TWO lines Ordering inside was pretty easy a couple order kiosks or a plexi barrier ed pair of cash registers Time spent waiting was a lot less than if waiting in the drive thru lanes s Clean tables and floor actually being mopped while I was there 
1,Quick accurate drive through Maybe too quick when not sure what is being ordered I asked about new deal She rattled off what comes with deal and placed order and gave total before I could digest what she said Slow down Fries were perfect I love the fries 
1,The food was good and fresh but the order was missing the fries I had ordered with the combo I ordered but didn t get the receipt and when I tried telling them the order was missing an item they told me I needed a receipt I get that but the fact that they didn t give me one and I gave them the order number and everything even showed them the order I received but they still wouldn t give me the item that was missing
1,Mobile ordering has made buying easier and coupled with their unbeatable deals makes for great fast food As others have said parking is scarce and cramped and the interior is VERY cramped I recommend drive through all the way
1,This McDonald s has probably been remodeled two or three times The interior is TINY Like REALLY TINY If you re here hunting happy meal toys they charge you for the toy some places will charge only You can use the McDonald s app here but beware the tricky mobile app order and pay Mobile is a pain to use they re not always able to know where your order is and it takes way longer to order on your phone or at a kiosk than it does in person Drive through doesn t get too bad because there s tons of food options nearby 
1,Love the pricing and unique item offerings 
1,Definitely a super busy drive through between the hours of and my order was taken accurately food was hot and it seemed like it was fresh no issues
1,I don t know why but I love their cheeseburgers something about the flavor of the meat that I really like I got Mcdoubles and chicken Mcnuggets for bucks its a good snack for a cheap price 
1,After leaving the Balboa shopping center I grabbed a Big Mac a few times They have the lane thing going on That s a plus 
1,Just your average Mac donalds the service was good and the place was clean
1,Food was good and the place was very clean Just need more room in dinning area 
1,The service is good and fast and the food is regular McDonald 
1,Mickey Dees Baby 
1,The staff was nice the restaurant is just a little small so be aware 
1,Staff is friendly and helpful Parking makes you scratch your head wondering What were they thinking 
1,Not the best customer services but it s McDonald s the food was good
1,I love the staff but the little Mac lack luster the buns was dry and the patty was burnt 
1,Fast and friendly place 
1,Very friendly employees wait time in drive thru is substantial on most days
1,Just a mac donald Drive thru was pretty fast when I went there late 
1,Fast accurate service Food was fresh 
1,Umm it s McDonald s Pretty good one tho 
1,I go for Friday Fillet O Fish Sandwich and French Fry s Yum Yum 
1,You know it s Mc D s always get what I expect 
1,Dropped in for some yummy fries on cheat day worth it 
1,You get exactly what you expect every time and I like it
1,Usually very crowded and very little space inside 
1,Good better than the vista location
1,Not many seats for dining in 
1,Pretty good fast food
1,You can t go wrong here 
1,Just like every other McDonald s
1,The food was good 
1,Good selection of food 
1,ALWAYS GREAT SERVICE
1,Small but nice

1,After exploring Chinatown in lower Manhattan I decided to walk to the only McDonald s in the immediate area on the south side of Canal Street It didn t look like much from the outside but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK and I told him Yes but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow I was pleased that the problem was solved Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area 
1,Pretty much a regular McDonald s has a second floor though That s cool 
1,Space is small typical for area Limited seating on ground level Additional seating and Restrooms upstairs
1,It s a McDonald s The kiosks were working and the service was quick I didn t go upstairs to check out the dining room 
1,The food was came out little late but the clerk gave apple pie for service I was really satisfied The icecream cone is little expensive than any other country 
1,A really good place to eat The place is very clean 
1,My best experience with Mango pin smooth was excellent and fast delivery good services
1,I m glad I enjoy the food 
1,Cofe was so bad just a hot water
1,Good prompt service as one would expect from them Only negative is that the soda fountain is still closed and they still only offer bottled soda which is more expensive and not cold 
1,Good deal Today I bought vanilla shake with a deal buy one get one free So I paid for large shake At Chinatown still only take out 
1,This McDonald s just east of Broadway on Canal is a good McDonald s Are here twice recently and the food was fine This McDonald s is much better than the McDonald s about half a mile South on Broadway south of Chambers That south McDonald s had old heat dried out food the four times I was there 
1,Hasn t had soda fountain for awhile pretty fast and friendly Always busy though don t expect a seat 
1,Would ve gave them stars but too many homeless people are inside
1,Too crowded but they were managing it well bathrooms were too dirty 
1,Stopped in just for an ice coffee Their ice coffee is solid overall an awesome bargain via app 
1,Great family friendly entertaining teenage students too But The toilets are too horribly maintained Smelly No mirrors used Tissue were heaped openly Very non hygienic May be the management is too busy short staffed 
1,It s McDonald s You kinda know what to expect One thing you should be prepared for if you re not a native of Manhattan it s very pricy I guess paying for the N Y rent causes the prices to be higher than what we have in Texas The service was fast and organized despite being very busy just don t expect to get your usual meal for your usual price Happy travels 
1,Good service but a lot of strange people entering the store People asking for money in aggressive way and the people in line ordering food looked concerned 
1,Very friendly morning staff
1,No compliant friendly customer service and food was given in a timely fashion
1,Is nice place they kipper clean up all the time good service
1, Happy Thanksgiving This McDonald s located at Canal Street in Chinatown New York City have been here for ages All McDonald s are created equal in terms of cleanliness so it is no surprise that it is very clean neat tidy and spotlessly clean It is a huge McDonald s because it has stories but on the second and third floor there is a limited number of chairs Poor design left it with about to seats on the top floors The staff is very professional friendly and polite with a smile and there are staff who are bilingual English and Chinese English and Spanish Enjoy Mickey D s and A Happy Thanksgiving 
1,The restaurant is kept clean and service is fast It s like the usual McDonald s you d expect but better However the food there is slightly priced higher than usual prices at different McDonald s Overall I d recommend 
1,Wonderful view over Broadway Central Park Service is very good You take a tablenumber place your order yourself and no matter which floor you sit and wait for your order to be brought to you they ll find you Amazing 
1,Good place for a quick bite Their menu has gotten better They will add new items to their menu every few months which is very nice of them to keep attracting customers 
1,It was absolutely amazing I went around closing time and it was no waiting time to be seated and my server Ty was amazing I had a great time and the drinks do it for me every time Hands own one of my favorite places to eat and drink 
1,This review is on their bathroom and small fries for obvious reasons So glad this place is hours I needed to use their bathroom so badly at pm I ordered a small fries and ran upstairs there was toilet paper which is a huuuge plus but their mirror I think someone stole it or something There is just hand soap on the wall and where the mirror should be were just screw holes LOL WELP
1,My kids like eat Macdonald
1,It s much cleaner now than it used to be They also have touchscreen monitors you can order from now which is convenient I found things that I never knew was on the menu 
1,Today one of my items was forgotten but I will check in tomorrow about it for a replacement Otherwise pleasant staff and quick service 
1,Have a couple kiosks in the front easy and nice to use Lots of customizable things to the order Make sure you scroll to the bottom and check out the deals and promotions Order was prepared pretty quickly and correct No big complaints about as good an experience that McDonalds can be Pro tip on the kiosk when you are checking out and it asks for your location code Just click cancel It s an error in the system 
1,Great coffee on a weekday Coffee on a Saturdays not so much 
1,I understand that it s just fast food but I eat fast food frequently Just lack the budget to indulge in sushi and other fine fare lol I m also not a sushi person I love as six mc Donald s for their cheap juicy burger fast orders and cheap shakes or if I m feeling like I want something lighter ony stomach and it s late a grilled chicken salad side asald or parfait is great Excellent for my son who asks for the yogurt in his kids meal The mozzarella sticks is also a perfect edition Their coffee exceeds bk and I loved this location wen visiting last month Quick easy and clean with upstairs seating The workers for friendly and helped me when they forgot a drink 
1,Very busy McDonald s next to Chinatown lots of Asian staff for those who are not fluent in English seating is always full but security actively enforce the no loitering rule 
1,Great place even for a McDonald s and the staff are kind and always willing to help No problem getting your food changed and the lines are never too long 
1,Manager saw me waiting a little longer than usual and went back to the kitchen to see what was wrong and got back with my order Very thoughtful 
1,Sometimes a little difficult to place the order however the staff are very friendly and the managers are always trying to get orders completed fast The food was always good and great coffee 
1,Fast friendly service but no dine in and no bathroom even if you re pregnant 
1,THE STAFF AT THIS LOCATION ARE ACTIVE AND VERY ENGAGING THEY ARE PEOPLE PERSON AND HAVE STRONG ATTENTION TOWARD THEIR CUSTOMERS THE INTERIOR OF THE RESTURANT IS VERY CLEAN 
1,LOL this Macky Ds is a fun one to go when you want to hit up Chinatown and all its glory I think I ate there only once and it was like any other Mc Ds but alot more people and alot more drama a sight to be seen 
1,Small size fairly clean and seating upstairs but not very wheelchair accessible seating 
1,Atlantic Terminal Busy place because another Mc Donald s is being renovated I used app to order so no wait Because so busy a little dirtier than normal 
1,It was a bit crowded but the service was fast and friendly My only downside was there was no handicap access to the upper floors 
1,Usually very pleased with the experience 
1,Excellent location This place is not very clean because it s too crowdy 
1,They are very friendly friendlier than any other branches out here in New York 
1,I went late at night and they were out of a few things Nothing I was trying to order though quick and efficient Be wary that NYC doesn t have deals on the McDonald s app like other cities do 
1,Not cleanest
1,Good fast service Busy but you won t have to wait long 
1,One of the cashiers were nice because there was no line ordering food was like chatting 
1,Fast service and ok food but no where to sit due to bums laying in the booths upstairs Maybe get some employees to check up there occasionally 
1,on a messy knockoff block
1,Just happy to find a place to get something quick to eat 
1,Food was fast fresh and hot Place was clean with rapid service
1,It s a McDonalds you get what you expect from here every time As a place for very fast cheap and consistent food it s good 
1,This location always has a crowd so I gave stars however they are extremely fast in service So if you re running late into the office this is the place to stop 
1,For a mcdonalds in an extremely busy area I think the staff were doing a great job keeping everything moving The area was clean enough and I am particular about that the kiosks were in working order besides one but it didn t hold up the orders at all Food deals were clearly marked the ordering system wasn t correct as you usually grab a tent and go to a table but one of the staff saw us wondering about it and told us to just put a number in so they were clearly attentive to what was going on around them Food came out quickly Same cost for food as any other mcdonalds anywhere Great quick cheap food for a late evening 
1,Dirty table but there are empty seats to eat in The atmosphere is not bad for McDonald s Their app doesn t have good deals anymore 
1,Cheap and fast order Tasty drink 
1,Nice place bery busy but the crew handle great also the food is on point few mcs have this i could eat again there
1,Quick clean and organized The only downside a lot of people I was sitting near some rather rude people but I can t really blame the restaurant for that Just a negative 
1,This location has a young crowd on the weekend They play good music while you drink frappe and have a big mac 
1,Why a 
1,Just went to get mcnuggets for my mom but it was too early for them to make yet It was only am They were still making breakfast So I went to Wendy at the S I ferry where they make the chicken mcnuggets any time 
1,I wanted barbecue sauce packets and they forgot to give me it 
1,Very up to date McDonald s Great customer service and fast service This is the first fast food service spot that I got my food in less than mins Usually I m waiting minutes 
1,I am a big fan of Mc Donalds I have tried it in more than countries so how can I skip when I am in New York USA Same taste different country 
1,We went in the evening on our way back to the hotel from a trip to the Liberty Island We were really hungry so we ordered lots of stuff The food and drinks were good The place has lots of seating space and you can order on the self help kiosks It seemed like the restrooms were not open as there was a gate towards its entrance but we didn t care because our hotel was nearby 
1,PROS This McDonalds is located right next to Madison Square garden making it an easy stop right before or after the game They are also very clean and the staff seemed to be nice The food came fast compared to other fast food places in the city CONS The touchscreens that you order your food on had a tough time scanning the vaccine card and the place was small inside compared to other fast food places OVERALL Great place near the garden but isn t my go to when I hit that area of the city
1,Staff is nice and they are fast to get the food out I only go in the morning for breakfast on the way to work Only issues are the norm in many places they don t clean the kiosks often and they are no wipes to do it yourself and have to be careful of people crowded by the doors 
1,Your typical McDonald s Which is generally why people visit McDonald s all around the world Consistency Could be a little cleaner But nothing that would turn one off Reasonable experience Reasonable service With expected pricing 
1,It is great thant you can actually eat inside the place no like many other restaurants in the area at the moment because of the omicron variant The bad thing it s that the personal in these particular McDonald s is slow you re going to have to wait for your food at least to minutes It is the price you have to pay if you want to eat inside haha
1,Not too busy everything was clean and service was good wait time wasn long even though their was a decent amount of customers And food was fresh as could be for fast food Also not one employee was rude Good visit and would recommend this one over some others in area 
1,Pretty clean place crowded of course but that can be overseen when you find a table Service is pretty speedy got my food pretty quickly Security by the bathroom though need your receipt just to use it Gets annoying hearing ma am wait sir your receipt You need a receipt Tip don t throw away your receipt until you leave and don t sit next to the bathroom if you don t wanna hear that everytime a person tries to enter the bathroom 
1,Very friendly staff The cashier right away greeted us and asked what we would like to order She was also very helpful explain the offers that were available Service was fast quick and extremely efficient Waiting time was less than minutes Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too Food was good The only reason I couldn t give this McDonald s a stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty Also the restrooms were dirty it could have been better other than that eatoutside and don t forget if you like my review please give it a thumbs up 
1,Have to say they finally up the game recently put security in the establishment to prevent certain unwanted people taking up seats early in the mng sleeping leaving a mess That no longer currently exists as i have seen the change myself Don t hesitate to enter the establishment for breakfast 
1,Great service Clean Unfortunately they have seedy people that love hanging out on the side walk This is not Mc Donald s fault However I feel safe and satisfied with the pace of service 
1,Thank you guys for your job and the effort to keep the place at the nice level even sometimes becomes messy but you always were friedly and ready to prepare my food order not the healthiest option tho but you always saved me from starving
1,It s a decent McDonald s The issue is its location it s a high tourist area and hub for New Yorkers to do a lot of shopping or transferring bus trains That also comes with people who are on drugs homeless and so on But it s not that bad
1,Very clean decent bathroom Lots of lost soles during the week hanging out But they are kept low and behaved Bathroom is kept clean and decent and they have a wall of ordering terminals to is I do suggest using an app and having it ready rather then the touch screen They have a long delay and it s a bit to order 
1,I enjoy this mc Donald s however you can t use the bathroom without first showing the receipt 
1,Crazy busy and usually encompassed with th Ave nutters but the security keeps everyone in check they ve always gotten my order right and regardless how busy they always manage to get orders out pretty darn quick ghettoefficiency
1,I didnt have a mask cause it suddenly broke while on line and the cashier offered me a mask I thought that was so awesome i was so happy causw they made me feel welcomed and not embrassed The staff was pleasant and quick serving 
1,McD s is a good place to eat fairly cheaply The wait time for your food DOES vary from restaurant to restaurant though Sometimes great sometimes terrible The food quality seems to be the same from restaurant to restaurant I love their sweet tea regular cheeseburger and their fantastic fries I would recommend it to people looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price 
1,Food was good Time to serve was fast enough and though as a first timer I never knew how to make orders via the machine Lol am just a new arrival from Africa we are use to human Services not computers Lol It was a good time overall 
1,Fast service but while I was there on vacation staying accross the street the service was a bit harsh 
1,Got my order pretty fast 
1,Istopped in at this location at am on Sun morning it was super busy and understaffed Surprisingly however the overwhelmed staff was super nice Even through the place was crowed it didn t take long to get a customized order The bathroom was understandably a mess 
1,Good and fast that what you call fast food
1,I d expect a McDonald s near Penn Station to be pretty terrible but they ve actually kept this location reasonably nice It 
1,I read the reviews and they were unkind but it was conveniently located Also coffee They have security to keep out the undesirables Weird to see security guards at McDonald s but I guess it is working The place was clean and being able to order at a kiosk made the wait time short even during the breakfast rush 
1,It s a big space it s a bit allover the place when it comes to management and foot traffic some go to this mcd s with the intention of hanging out The service is a hit and miss and at times the place can be a bit dirty but the prices r decent for the area 
1,If you are passing through and need a place to eat or you don t have time to put dinner on the table usually this is you re next option But before going anywhere else to eat come here first If you are looking for people who still care about there job in this day in age and are dedicated to making there service the best it can possibly be this is where you should go 
1,Unfortunately the covid pandemic has rendered eating within mcdonalds not possible it a rather elegant one Clean composed every bit the lady and her staff are professional Fast food done right Money low from all the shopping and touring take swin
1,Quick clean efficient social distanced order delivery pick up system excellent job and the food was fresh 
1,Often busy because of the high flow of traffic in the area but as far as a McDonald s goes it is not bad Service is quick prices are good food is consistent for the most part 
1,The foods pretty good But you have to pay to use the restroom But the foods awsome and the ice cream machine works
1,McDonalds spicy chicken sandwich and fillet o fish was delicious Very clean and fast service 
1,Love the new touch screen menus Staff was friendly and efficient Tables were so so clean had to wipe up my own 
1,Good place if you like McDonalds like our kids
1,The best street food in the nyc I don t know what type of Charcoal the use But the Taste is unique I love this street food so much That I go to after I featen from a restaurant in the same neighborhood The season they put on top of the chicken thigh is to die for 
1,Location Right by the A C train line and M bus floor Clean Lots of sketchy individuals out front Service Always fast Wait Hardly ever a long line

1,I never dine in but if I do eat here it is through the drive thru They always have great customer service which is really nice The food sometimes is not so great Either ingredients are missing probably do to food outage and sometimes my food is cold which is super undesirable This place isn t bad it could definitely improve 
1,Popular restaurant for people Location is convenient parking is easy I use drive through most of the time Prices are a few cents than other locations in this area in some items prices are varied with restaurant locations 
1,I like the fact it has longer hours then most of them If only some of the employees that work drive thru were alittle more friendly Instead of being short fused and somewhat rude 
1,New store technology and modern layout Hope their food and service are at same level after the remodeling They forgot to replace the soda machine Oh ohh
1,I would have given stars but the lady MNGR that took my order got one item wrong I did not notice until I was long gone Also the COVID headache is pretty much behind us but for some odd reason this location still has a limited restricted dining room even to the point of closing it down completely at pm everyday I can understand being cautious prepared but to use the pandemic as a way to justify limiting restricting areas of an establishment that we as patrons normally use on any normal regular day is unprofessional inconvenient just a way for them to make it easier to keep clean one less thing to be done when it comes to closing down for the night However though this ranting raving I am doing in this post I still get good customer service there when I do go for a quick easy meal Their drive thru is conveniently open hrours
1,That day I brought the kids having activities in South Bay Santa Clara After the event I tried to bring the kids to mcd i went two and they both closed at pm At least the south city mcd dining room opens till pm 
1,They did not give us straws we had to go back through the Drive Thru and wait in a big line of cars has lanes for ordering and was actually pretty busy They were a the on the slow site but we just figured it was all the people coming back to get their straws other than that it was just your regular McDonald s experience very grateful it was open though since covid you don t find to many hrs locations that still actually stay open all night as hours state That in itself is a whole different issue and honestly very difficult to figure out without driving down an unlit window on a drive thru with a sign stating we re open Hours I gave it a because food was warm and fresh and drinks were on point except luck of a straw 
1,Can not beat mcdonalds for their quick service and food Though their best menu item is still the coffee 
1,So much improvement They re serving good fries now newly cooked vs saggy and felt like microwave warmed before Curbside pick up was so helpful We ll comeback 
1,Good fast food They are open hours a day which is great if you are working a night shift graveyard shift or have to go in early in the morning Their new menu is actually quite good I do wish the McRib was back in season but oh well you can t have it all Try the Minutemaid Slushies They are outstanding 
1, Usually fast service Mostly friendly customer service some people could be more kind Quarter pounders always fresh Ice cream works times I ve ordered
1,The two McFlurrys that my party ordered seemed to not be whipped which was unfortunate Otherwise the food was prepared quickly even though we went during the lunch rush Parking nearby could be full during lunch 
1,The only thin I can say is they need to stay up to date with the Happy Meal toys they Advertise My kid comes in super excited to see the stand box with the Advertised toys to somet being told the doth Have those at this time
1,Fast but the line always long and sometimes it take so long for one customer Curbside pickup take longer than drive thru 
1,It s not a junk foods place anymore They start having healthy menu and I think it s great with the price You can pick your own bread type of meat and vegetable End the menu with Sundae ice cream 
1,Good ol micky D s same thing as usual nothing really changes but one thing this I ve been going to this location for quite a while every morning order same thing a LARGE ICE HAZELNUT and a MED REG COFFEE with a few fixings added most of the employees know me on a HELLO basis same for two MANAGERS there they see ME in line they make eye contact with me I shake my head get to the counter Cashier ask me the USUAL SUR i say yes and BLAM there s my two morning favorites so i go every day just to see great EMPLOYEES of this location 
1,It opens and it s very close to where I live I usually order from drive through They put sugar in my coffee when I ordered black coffee This was their only mistake I have experienced 
1,It s fast it s food it s cheap It could be better it could be faster it could be cheaper but it s familiar food and it s never terrible food sometimes it is even good food So if you need reasonable quality food quickly and cheaply McDonald s is your place 
1,Vegetarians like me don t have many options in McDonald s for the breakdown menu Hence taking away star 
1,Good service here and prices were affordable Always love me some fries and the Big Mac Mocha frappe is yummy 
1,It s just another McDonald s lol standard food and look no play house update renovated new touch screen ordering Improved
1,The drive through at this location is typically fast Parking to dine in can be difficult due to drive through lines Better than the average MacDonald s 
1,I ve gone to this location a few times and my fries and limo every dang time Nuggets were fresh but fries were a waste of money 
1,I am just wondering why so many people writing reviews for a McDonald Are they all the same everywhere And who has not taste a McDonald before So do not expect it to be as good as a decent restaurant but it will do when you are hungry 
1,this place has the best shamrock shakes if you go during March the shamrock shakes are amazing it s really affordable just kidding that s why it s actually pretty expensive cause it s so good but you won t regret purchasing a shamrock shake
1,It s a McDonalds They are all pretty similar But the bathrooms are clean and the staff is friendly I find it interesting that they removed the charging stations But once again McDonalds not Starbucks 
1,service pretty good for McDonald s I find myself going out of the way for their drive thru coz their order accuracy is on point 
1,Not a lot of options to pick from but generally it was good Fast service for drive through 
1,The best thing about this place is that it is open x But then they are slow at times also for the drive through so I recommend to have enough time in hand 
1,Fish sandwich was cold and French vanilla latte tasted horrible when I went at about am
1,This place has that usual McDonald s quality Which isn 
1,Would have appreciated more of that awesome sauce on my piece nuggets but great experience overall

1,This McDonald s is almost always busy While it s not the quickest the staff here are always friendly and there are excellent deals waiting in the McDonald s app 
1,Awhile back I made a bad review but since then major improvements to the restaurant and the service have been made Solid McDonalds
1,Sometimes some employee doesn t pay attention and been standing there but no one is coming to help sometimes it shows attitude too
1,Drive thru was great and the person that took the order is nice and friendly

1,Did drive through because of time of day am Got the Sausage Egg McMuffin with decaf coffee Window drive through ladies were very pleasant and polite even brewed fresh decaf for us 
1,One of my favorites places for gatherings and quick bites They are quick great customer service and excellent teamwork atmosphere Keep the good work 
1,I did the drive thru service the lady who collected the money at the window was awesome I m so sorry I didn t get her name She put a smile on my face 
1,Almost perfect language barrier I believe caused the confusion on a very simple not too light large Iced coffee no flavor creams and pumps of sugar min later I left with their version of my request The associate remained professional and polite Even through my obvious frustration I give her 
1,The chicken nuggets was cold also the bread 
1,I didn t t like the kiosks I rather have someone take my order instead
1,it s local so our most used location and it s really as you would expect with McDonald s in general Sometimes it s great and no issues and sometimes food is a little colder than you d hope for or missing items from orders and such I d say we have more good experiences than bad and stars is fair 
1,Food is usually good but they mess up orders pretty frequently My last double cheeseburger had a piece of chicken in the middle instead of beef It ll get the job done though 
1,Clean and friendly service 
1,Thanks for the perfect iced coffee I got The price for for a large you can not go wrong I go here about every couple days since it is almost in my back yard The food usually is good and service is fast Friendly staff serving you I am so glad that this location is remodeling the play area So excited to see how it will look considering I can walk there in min Gotta Love It 
1,About what you expect from a McDonald 
1,The people who work here are always kind to me when I go in The food has always been correct and I do tend to take something off when I order the McChicken sandwiches The only issue I have is the time period in which they only accept cash but I do not blame them I just don t carry cash on me 
1,Normal fast food service was a little slower than normal due to not enough employees on site
1,Great service Service representatives are nice and helpful Just don t forget to ask for extra condiments 
1,Great service Sometimes they get orders wrong but they are always clean and are very nice and get my food fast 
1,Don t eat at McDonald s often but service seemed slower than usual there Guess people don t want to work 
1,The service has come a long way from two years ago but it s still not perfect but then again nothing is perfect The dining are was super clean 
1,Stopped by for a hot fudge sundae Service was fast and enjoyed my time there Place was very clean

1,Good
1,Go
1,Friendly employees
1,I only took one glass and it was very thick They should make them softer when drinking it 
1,The food is good but the portions are very small for the price The attention is good the place clean and organized the bathroom clean and modern I love McDonald s 
1,On several occasions I have gone I bought and then I did not get what I asked for or requested and I have to exchange it for something else They should be more aware of their inventory
1,It is a place to take the children to have them play They often get the orders wrong But overall it s not that bad
1,The mask against the virus did not let me speak English well with the girl from the driver though up
1,The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or Minnesota Also the McDonald s app has great deals If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount Since I have frequented McDonald s for a long time I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery On the one side the meal is typically pretty decent and I like the quick and convenient service However there are some problems that I ve come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn t as positive as it once was The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries Every time I visit McDonald s it seems like the costs have increased once again This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives Another problem is that McDonald s used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous This is disappointing because I ve always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch Having said that there are still a few aspects of McDonald s that I genuinely value The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good and the quickness of service is still unmatched The restaurant is always spotless and well kept making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run Overall I would say that McDonald s is still a good option for fast food but because of the rising costs and less promotions it has lost its place as my top pick However a typical McDonald s burger and fries are a great choice if you re searching for a quick and delectable dinner 
1,It was very cheap compared to what I m used to in California can easily buy two full combo meals likely even more Food is decent as expected 
1,Nobody spoke English well enough to get my order correct The food sucked as did the employees who were dirty and unkempt almost as bad as the restaurant was NEVER AGAIN 
1,The drive thru can get backed up but it s a busy place The parking is very strict so be careful if you re trying to
1,It s McDonald s you know the food and taste there it never changes
1,Fast service and the staff always have a friendly attitude 
1,Slow and I am no longer in the area a little after then I will be home all day but it is an apartment and if something does need to be signed for the front desk can do that any day M S or any of the information included I am not going on the website to be sure to send it out of state or state to send me the link and I ll get you a copy and I ll get you the money to you by tomorrow afternoon and I ll get you sick and I will 
1,This McDonalds comes with a free homeless show when utilizing the dine in option No purchase necessary subject to talent intoxication levels results may very 
1,Everything was OK except all the food was placed in one bag over the top I asked for several bags and the problem was fixed 
1,While I m there lots of wrong orders thought they won t mistake mine Didn t find put except after I left
1,They are good at making McDonald s food
1,Literally the best mcdonalds to go to in the early early a m but watch out for the overcooked or stale fries Hardly ever been there and systems updating or down so it s my go to spot when alot of places are closed 
1,Due to the app I had a Bic Mac with no purchase necessary I wasn t looked down upon and was treated like everyone else I did but a soda but still They did not know that I was going to do that 
1,There was a security guard here in the middle of the day on a Tuesday Not sure what to make of that Food service was fine 
1,The cheeseburgers and chicken sandwiches I order from every McDonald s were noticeably better here The extra onions were actually noticeable at this location but what really caught my attention was the beef patty It was still hot when I got and juicy too so I know it was fresher than most other McDonald s The chicken patty was still hot too and I could taste the spice more than usual as well This would have been a but the drive through speakers wasn 
1,I mean it s McDonald s you 
1,Pretty good experience considering I didn t buy anything this time Not too spectacular to get around the peeps hangin around outside for no reason but it IS downtown and the only McDonald s for a pretty big radius Inside was pretty good with the new self order station things They ve recently done some good renovations Not too shabby McD s not too shabby 
1,Tad bit slow in drive through But other than that usual MC Donald s experience and consistent taste Value for money breakfast 
1,Newly remodeled very clean for now Service was pretty decent I would say slightly better than average as far as McDonald s is concerned I love using the app to place mobile orders much easier that way especially during the lunch rush Food was well it s McDonald s Pretty average food too 
1,I spend a lot of money at this location and I haven t really ever had a bad experience the only downfall with this restaurant is it states that it is hours yet it is closed during hours of the night and as I just stopped to get my breakfast this morning after a m it was closed again sometimes they are even closed in the middle of the day so it is not always open as stated but it has always treated me well when it comes to customer service and food quality
1,Always professional and quick very convenient on the way to the highway Do not park here if you re just going to the liquor store i have been booted before Still come here though cause good service 
1,Went here at midnight Staff was nice quick and effective Long line and the staff didn t waste any time 
1,The line was pretty long but they moved us along fairly quickly Food was warm and my order was correct Not much else to say about a fast food joint
1,Nice new remodel Clean and well maintained Good food 
1,I would love the exact location McDonald s i dined at This one employee only seemed to be against having me eat there The woman cashier literally did nt want to order with the for one menu sandwich deal i just recieved on on my phone She wouldn t offer me a pen to write my code on the receipt so i used a penny to write the code so she tells me it s invalid but i wrote the exact code and it looked as though i wrote in oencile She immediately try calling security so i asked the other employees for a manager The manager was very understanding and even after helped with all and left to the back the woman tells me how this is my last order and i have minutes left to eat It was ammusing so i played the idiot customer roll I definitely appreciate the manager s understanding for i was also a little short on exact cash so you can already guess how the woman treated me about that On the plus side I enjoyed my meal 
1,Orders are always accurate and well made I haven t usually had to wait long at the drive thru They are not currently offering dine in service 
1,Loved my watermelon slush at PM thank you hour McDonalds 
1,Ok for fast food Parking lot and drive thru traffic makes the lot dangerous Poorly designed Usually always crowded The worst is when they ask you to pull up to window to wait for your food and then they serve cars behind you while you sit there and wait 
1,Never had a problem here except my last order we forgot our drinks in drive through and got someone else s order which only fed my daughter but I m sure it was a simple mistake to make no fus over besides i got cereal for dinner haha
1,I visited McDonald s today and got a big Mac No complaints The food was good and I got what I expected The servers were courteous and I got my food fairly quick They got me in and out All in all a great visit 
1,This location is always very busy They are Fairly quick at serving people but the lines are very long especially in the drive through Staff never seems very friendly maybe bc they see so many ppl 
1,I got a quarter pounder with cheese no one is extra pickles and it was perfect The fries were a little bit chilled and my son it was fine 
1,This store was ok the employees could have been a lit nicer and at least act like they was some what thankful they had a job and the food showed how the employees where acting witch was ok but now good
1,Friendly staff and nice atmosphere Nice garden out front
1,I was thinking oh just micky d s sound ok maybe ill get a mocha frapee went inside instead of drivethrew Anyway was blown away to see everyone ordering themselves from a touch screen They had four stations and were very easy to use was also very satisfied with this particular locations quality
1,Great customer service Even with it being lunch hour downtown Worker s were cordial and efficient at getting the job done Literally were in and out 
1,I Really Like Their Sausage Egg N Cheese McGriddle Breakfast Sandwiches YUMMY 
1,Makes good chocolate chip frappes and orders are usually correct Sometimes the people that take your order through the mic in the drive through are uncaring and depressing and sometimes they are friendly
1,Food is edible when they get my order right of the time my order is not right But don t get me wrong i like the food that s why i go back even tho they get my order wrong 
1,My wife and I wanted some soda at nearly midnight McDonald s was open the soda was cheap and the person who had maybe a Thai accent was nice despite the lateness of the hour 
1,I d rate it four stars like I did with In N Out For the price the food is good and I m definitely grateful that McDonald s exists 
1,Always good and this location is open for drive through We ordered a cheese burger meal and a fish sand meal It was very good 
1,This particular McDonald s had a hobo chilling in there He asked for a sandwich and I got him a sausage McMuffin Then this punk decides that s not enough and steals my buddy s order How messed up is that Like I get you re hungry but so was my friend 
1,The McDonalds is fine they got our large order correct and everything tasted fine just in kind of a sketchy neighborhood Look out for creepy dudes talking to themselves they might punch your car 
1,Pretty much same experience that u will find at all other McDonald s food is fast staff is compliant bathrooms can be hit or miss good thing is breakfast is served all day now and large drinks are still one dollar
1,They had those cool self order things They weren t super responsive though and it was kind of annoying Everything else was good or at least normal for McDonald s 
1,Very quick service at a busy time of day
1,Slow location but fries were excellent
1,The customer service is a lot better then the McDonald s off of s 
1,Ordered sausage McMuffins and a large drink McMuffins were cooked good and not burnt on the edges Not bad
1,Great service and clean establishment Fountain soda machine didn t work properly during my visit and got just syrup 
1,Customer service was in okay I wish I spoke a little Spanish it would have been better if you know what I m saying
1,Super quick and correct even with modifications 
1,Food is usually pretty fresh at this location Make sure to check your order when you use drive thru
1,The drive through workers were extremely helpful and verified my order at both windows I was impressed with that 
1,Clean and the staff was awesome Food got to us quick Note to customers the Restrooms lock
1,They ve made some improvements The help is friendly You still have to keep an eye on your vehicle though 
1,This McDonald s is the best one in the area It is always pretty clean and always good service They can be quite busy sometimes though 
1,Service was kinda fast employees seem to have attitudes tho Bathrooms were clean too

1,Food was hot n fresh I was there for just a few minutes 
1,Food was good we had some difficulties with our order 
1,I mean I guess it s food that is etible but a trash barricade kept me from going inside so I had to use the drive thru
1,Their very fast my food was great
1,They were very slow at the drive up Their food was ok
1,Hot food was hot Cold food cold Tasted fresh good service
1,Now with self service kiosks so you can be sure to get a correct order 
1,Stop here almost every morning before work Bacon egg and cheese biscuit is delicious
1,Clean nice people Chicken strips were overcooked and rubbery even when I got a second order 
1,Food and service where good but too many homeless roaming outside 
1,Nice to eat in a group of hobos I heard a lot about the way cows are killed for some reason
1,Usually good staff The security guard is a really nice person
1,It s a McDonald s Luckily they have a fast drive through 
1,Needed to charge my phone Noone harassed me good to see there busy working and not bother fellow humans
1,Your basic McDonald s finally opened to Dine in

1,Im not fan of this place but always I visit I have a very good experience 
1,Very dirty in the hall fast service delicious food
1,A lot of homeless folks at this location food comes out really quickly
1,I went to the drive thru easy fast and accurate 
1,Washington DC downtown five blocks from the White House so do the math I had the munchies I needed to eat McDonald s is the place
1,It s McDonalds what is there to say I love the relatively reasonable prices not sure why a double cheeseburger is on the menu but the single hamburger is almost twice the price or why a small fries is but they allowed me to pay what I usually pay for lunch at Panera and not only feed myself a hamburger but get the homeless and disabled person asking for money outside the front door a meal that he asked for a double cheeseburger and a slushie when I didn t have any cash 
1,Clean plenty of places to sit and enjoy your meal 
1,From a quick visit about months ago Dining room was small seemed clean my order was to go so didn t spend much time inside Loved the digital menu self order kiosks ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register though not sure if that option s still available and or if the dining room s even open right now Staff was friendly enough and very helpful packed my to go order like absolute pros The area where the fountain drinks straws etc are wasn t super tidy a bit of a spill on the countertop if memory serves however seemed clean otherwise Because it was such a quick trip didn t get to see the condition of the bathrooms a good indicator of an establishment s working and overall conditions in my experience Maybe another time Overall a good experience Something to consider there s no drive through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare hit or miss in that area Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving not sure how often that happens though Score The previous parking spot I d found was about blocks away doable but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD s 
1,Stopped by for breakfast a few times while in town Self order kiosks were great but didn t have directions I ordered without issue but watched a few people walk out after not being able to figure it out and having
1,Food was great but dollars for breakfast for one person Wow 
1,You guys do have mocha coffee right Cause sometimes ya ll think I m talking about a frappe And then I give up and ask for a regular I mean I don t really care but sometimes I suspect I m being gaslighted Like you guys know something that I don t You know what I m saying Where you keepin the mocha man
1,The McDonalds on M Street is newly renovated and spacious You place your order on touch screen and take a table number and the food is delivered How about that fast food that is that and convenient BTW THE MCRIB IS BACK 
1,After spending top dollar on fancier dinning establishments it was nice not to have a meal run me over They also signature sanwhichs which are quite tasty 
1,The right place to eat when I have no time and want good tasting food I had Caramel Iced Coffee and I ordered a Big Mac the girl suggested that I can get one extra Big Mac for a minimal amount it was almost free it was a good decision 
1,Service was good and fast Store was clean and nicely update 
1,Very kind and pleasant staff members Much Cleaner than other local McDonalds franchise locations 
1,The foods greatly improved in flavor and price with the new menu but if there is a Wendy s nearby you should go to that instead 
1,This visit they were a little slow at the drive thru Otherwise everything was great 
1,Its good to see they have self order
1,Not bad it s not too far from my apt 
1,Just as you would expect Fresh food served promptly Clean location

1,Not very good attention from the employees of the place One of the employees who was serving me spoke to me in a way that was not very well seen on my part When I got there she looked like I was a beggar because I was working and decided to go eat However the employee said as yes what will you want No No No But in a disgusting way But I ignored him and left the place In addition the restaurant has a second floor for those who are not in a hurry to go for lunch breakfast or whatever There is something very good about this place is that there are staff who speak Spanish and English This place is also extremely close to the Honduran Embassy I recommend this place

1,A cool little get away spot in the city when you need that FREE WIFI and also coffee I love it The staff are not too welcoming but they are in the center of traffic with people shopping and across the street from Madison Square Garden But I still like the location Check it out Eat Play Shop Live Life Unscripted
1, The McDonalds took a while to get our service as it was a bit slow however once we recieved it the food was tasty The decor and surroundings provided a pretty good atmosphere I would recommend a stop by for sure get some classic maccas in ya 
1,Nice location at an upper floor inside Macy s Good for tired famished shoppers Take the window seats and get a good view of New York below 
1,Typical McDonald s food service is ok not the worse to be in dtla atmosphere varies since the security takes care of business 
1,He told us we have to go back around to order a Coke and then they forgot one of my frappuccinos but the wine was out and down the street in LA I called the manager over she took care of it right away at least the frappuccino I didn t worry about the soda my honey didn t need one anyways bad for you but every non stop there everything was fine and it was up to par
1,Good fast and great workers But sketchy people around due to the greyhound and local bums But they do have top flight security around so all around ok
1,Very small McDonalds with security and nice staff Bathrooms are accessible and clean Primarily a drive thru though
1,The food was fresh it was surprisingly clean very friendly 
1,Usually are pretty good Except my last visit I had ordered a box of cookies They messed up and gave me a bag which had cookies in it I emailed them and they still haven 
1,Good customer service fast service and very patient 
1,The difference in taste of the meat from the Big Mac to the quarter pounder was astronomical Like it didn t even come from the same type of animal So will not be doing the Big Mac again They were fast and they were friendly but still McDonald s 
1,It s not your typical McDonald s They re over price on their menu plus they do not accept coupon or does any special like regular McDonald s I think they feel the need to make their money from the Disneyland patron and it s ridiculous toward the regular customer s but it s all boil down to make money Sometimes they can be rude toward the black customer but what to expect from seeing who goes into this franchise Most of the customer that goes into this store are traveller which is mostly Caucasian
1,If you are visiting this particular McDonald s you ll notice that you are very nearly in the middle of the strange no man s or woman s land encompassing skid row and the new upwardly trendy lofts and shops that seek to define Download Los Angeles This McDonald s manages to straddle this uncomfortable melange quite nicely The inside of the restaurant was bright and clean The counters looked new and the menu sign actually was orderly laid out with sensible photos next to the main items I don t eat fast food often and the overhead menus always confuse me with super this and extra large that I know that I am not getting the best price ever But this menu seemed far simpler we ordered and our food was served quickly with my special request done just right We ate in and the table was clean as was the floor It s true we were approached twice by people asking for money but they were not intrusive and I had the feeling the manager and staff were well aware of who was in the restaurant and I didn t feel uncomfortable at all The staff was so attentive that for the first time I actually filled out the online survey just to compliment them That s quite a compliment in itself coming from me 
1,It s a nice place I have not dined in But even when the line looks long during the morning I can honestly say that they provide a faster service to get you out ASAP 
1,The food at this location is usually hot and fresh Services usually quick Today however my breakfast sandwich had a lot of egg shells in it That doesn t usually happen but you still have to be careful nonetheless
1,Car ordering not so great Walk in was quick and especially clean all around 
1,Ver small dinning area most orders to go many people who are traveling by greyhound go for last meal before leaving town 
1,It was great other than the soda options weren t the best not much to choose from should definitely have root beer as an option I think they should get the new touch screen soda dispenser there that had plenty of soda options to choose from would be very nice 
1,Everything went quickly done was well 
1,Fast customer service Manager is friendly They treat homeless with equal respect Thumbs up for that Fries were not as good as I expected Thats why I give points 
1,They was nice but no more food on the menu I was not very happy about this with me living on a goverment check so I don t have to much money when I was told that they stoped the dollar menu so with me not having to much money I got some thing to eat no I wouldn t go back to no McDonald s because of no more dollar menu I will be going to like Burger King they have a dollar menu or Jack In The Box the meal are a lot cheaper than McDonald s I think they lost their minds not having the dollar menu no more other than that they was very nice because I m in a power wheelchair
1,I ve never actually gone inside this location but I use the drive thru fairly regularly It s a pretty busy spot but even before they put in the dual lane ordering system the service was always quick 
1,Had the mcdonald s egg sausage cheese meal along with my girlfriend for a quick breakfast before heading home from L A to San jose it hit the spot since i was in a hurry 
1,They order for you on the touch screen if theyre busy The only McDonald s I tried where their hash brown didnt come out hot and fresh Very disappointed and will not order breakfast at this location 
1,They cool no handle picking up from they me 
1,Stopped for a quick meal in between bus stops They provided quick service and thankfully no errors on the food order Appreciated that the diner was relatively clean 
1,I tried curbside delivery using the McDonald s app and it worked The only problem is that there are only delivery spots and regular eat in customers park in them That defeats the purpose Inside the place was clean and there are self service ordering kiosks 
1,Great service The only reason it is and not ia because of the homeless people who are never satisfied If you give them a dollar they ask for another one If no money is available then they ask for cigs If no cigs are available they ask for food last Im getting tired of it 
1,Holy wow The lattes here are super delicious Spanish latte creamy but not milky latte with a hint of cinnamon that isn t overpowering Lavender matcha latte strong matcha flavor that compliments the lavender It s not milky at all I really like floral matcha
1,It s a good place to talk
1,Person came out to help me in the drive through I do great employee She was very helpful

1,It s always busy and especially pick up window
1,The store was very busy and full of customers I didn t like the way they greet the customers and the way they talked to each individuals It was busy and that can t be an excuse for bad service Food was great as usual but service gotta improve by mile The cleanliness was an issue also as there were napkins pretty much all over the place I guess it was not cleaned since evening May be business is the priority which is not what Mc does I believe 
1,I like this McDonald s because it has delicious food and quick service 
1,Rude staff great burger The ladies at the counter were rude bored not smiling very unpleasant welcoming They should not be hired for hospitality businesses The bacon burger was great hot tasty crunchy One of the best Good job the kitchen Only an old white lady was smiling at the front 
1,Good price chek the food for one two tre dollar always find chip for that money 
1,The service was good but there was this weird guys that was asking for money to buy a sandwich to eat which I had no problem giving him and the other guy going in and out and sitting down together with the guy asking for money to eat a sandwich and asking out for or lucy in case for those who dont understand its cigarettes The managers should be putting additional people at the register for them to see thilese things because the look on some customers where not comforting with the situation

1,The courtesy and politeness of the staff is excellent 
1,We are visiting from out of state and have eaten here several times Highly recommend ordering at the kiosk as it takes a while for a cashier to take your order 
1,The drivethru line at this location is had been and will always be broken Dont ask me why because i do not know Maybe it is because the rd window is rarely used Idk but go inside if you have a small order as its faster to go to a register Check your order when they are super busy as they give you a diet or another order on occasion Otherwise my favorite place to get a large coke for 
1,Love the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle 
1,This McDonald s was and normally is always very fast and my orders always correct The only thing is the past few times I ve been my chicken sandwich was not good at all and the French fries were not fresh but then pumpkin and holiday pies were the best The staff is always nice tho You can t dine in or done on their patio You can t use their restrooms either They do wear face masks and require you to wear one when going inside the establishment They re hours in their drive thru not exactly sure about going inside to because the last time I went inside to order I was there around pm and they were still open for togo orders Breakfast hours are Monday thru Sunday starting at am Monday t

1,Getting better with service Nice people 
1,The staff has to constantly deal with the homeless community that is always loitering around this place The McDonald s restaurant is clean and the food is up to par but the environment could be better 
1,Four stars only because it s open hours not just the drive thru and is one of the few late night bathroom options for Lyft and Uber drivers Popular with the homeless crowd for the same reason though and it s still a McDonald s eat at your own risk 
1,Newly remodeled outside of store Looks great Fast drive through Sometimes there are too many homeless hanging around in or outside the parking lot 
1,Good food good attitudes of the employees only downside is the main lobby floor was very sticky almost to the point of me walking out of my sandles 
1,Inflation is really hitting americans 
1,It was smooth Fries were fresh Shake was on point This location is a good one Location by my house is trash Lol
1,Great for a late night snack However there needs to be more workers at night as it seems there are long wait times for food during the late night hours

1,Not the best McDonalds but it s around the corner from my place Drive thru speaker often has trouble with the order but everything usually comes out alright

1,Stopped in for a quick visit at this newly built location Nice bright dining room with fresh flowers on the tables The usual self ordering screens or a helpful staff behind the counter waiting to take your order If you are in need of food on the go this location has you covered Two drive through lanes and mobile order curbside spots so as to get you back on the road faster As McDonalds go this is a great improvement 
1,Very clean and has a kiosk that you can order Drive through is available as well 
1,Typical McDonald s fast service
1,The food is good Orders get filled properly There were PAST experiences when my order was messed and once I waited hours for my order to be done properly I 
1,The service was great surprisingly Our food was hot and they actually had our order completely correct Which is a big plus for this McDonald s I do recommend McDonald s if you go at the right times
1,Service is slow even even when the place is empty I wouldn t dare go when the place is actually busy It s a bit expected since it s so close to the border The interior seems pretty clean and the customer service is decent I ve only been on days when it s not busy so my experiences have been decent 
1,I usually go there every morning but my order usually gets messed up at least once a week with that being said they do replace my meal for free on the following visit 
1,Stuff is super polite and nice and helpful stars because if you pay at a kiosk grab a receipt and a table number find a place proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a limbo your order is not shown on any display you have no clue when and how you will be served We waited for a good min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be served He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will help Suggestion to the higher management All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade McCheers 
1,Last stop before entering Canada I recommend grabbing a bite here because one thing awaits you for sure for hrs at the other side of the border traffic Grab a bite and if you re coming back from Canada I think they accepted all of my Canadian change that I had left so that was convenient too 
1,Easy and clean place to stop once you come back into the US from the Canadian border The coffee is good and restroom is clean Decour is a bit dated but the food comes out fast and taste the way it should 
1,The foods always good here but the waiting time sucked Its like nobody in there wanted to work this night Almost minutes waiting for simple orders and it was at the end and it wasn t packed Smh
1,Drive thru can be very slow Your better off to go in order on the kiosk then leave with your food if you don t want to dine in The food is comparable to other McDonald s franchises I ve been to 
1,Same as every other McDonald s
1,It s one of the most techi mcdonalds out there However it does occasionally take more than a few minutes to get your food in the drive through on a busy day You re better off to go in an order from the kiosk and sit at the tables They all have flowers on them 
1,It was backed up after baseball and bcuz a bunch of electrical workers came in off of But after just a few minutes wait the drive thru started working very rapidly 
1,This place doesn t serve McLobster roll anymore We used to go there twice a summer for their lobster roll I gave a stars became of the interior quality 
1,Fast service very clean great stop at the border
1,It s no longer a cheap meal ours usually for two people cost around bucks but the coffee is good and we know that the food is always to a certain standard which is very important when we re traveling on the highway and we don t know the restaurants 
1,Well decorated typical micky d s 
1,This McDonald s location could be cleaner They need to may attention to the Self Serve station a tad more Otherwise typical McDonald s experience 
1,New building New Kids working same old MickeyDs food They still have the same great coffee and that s why I go there

1,Same as any other McDonald s
1,Food was fresh and the staff was very polite Only had to wait a bit 
1,Very nice folks for me my breakfast in record time Obviously McDonald s cannot be compared to a steakhouse or similar 
1,Better than McDonald 
1,Best McDonald they even have flowers on the table I felt like Princess Kate when she has breakfast at the Birmingham palace
1,Although slow service at least it is newly renovated and has self serve machines

1,Slow service because there is few people working there at in the morning Janitor was nice to let us into the restrooms that require a keycode It was mostly empty in the dining area the line and the parking lot There was however a very long drive thru line 
1,Great experience when I asked for more condiments twice other times some people get a bothered face x breath in breath out is my advice on that x 
1,Daughter wanted the Travis Scott burger She says it s a hit or miss with her friends I ordered the newly freeze drink which gave me an adult brain freeze and it wasn t as sweet like the Icee back in the day I wouldn t order it again 
1,Long drive through but always worth that unique McDonald s taste The Filet O Fish with the humongous glob of tartar sauce that slides out NO matter how hard you try all over your shirt while you re driving One of my favorites As a favorite I feel I shouldn t have to wait for for it 
1,Wait time is too long and ordered french fries n it was cold
1,This location is much better since they got dual drive thru lanes it s much faster and efficient now Sidenote they never have salads 
1,The place was great the person at the drive thru was so nice 
1,Although the two drive thru lines were pretty long when I got there the service was very fast and accurate 
1,This is the only McDonald s that is close to my house but honestly I don t really like it For some reason they are always slow The drive thru is always packed 
1,Clean and modern inside 
1,It s clean but a transit hub for the transit people I took the bus there myself hahaha but I d like to imagine I m not ugly 
1,Stopped n breakfast sandwiches coffee horrible 
1,This particular location has a narrow drive thru which is connected to the parking lot Service is nice but it closes at am whxih sucks 
1,Hot cakes and sausage plate
1,McDonald s is so much better this days you can place your order and pay for it without waiting in line 
1,I been to this McDonald s twice the first time they wer kinda slow but I like the nice peaceful clean environment looks freshly remodeled
1, large size with a Coke piece nuggets with sweet sour and hot mustard 
1,Inexpensive food on the go Wish they have a faster time of service 
1,The cashier was extremely patient when I allowed my son to order his own meal 
1,i dnt really eat out but i went there very good on the crispy chicken burger very nice workers

1,Service was good employees are always polite
1,Burgers very good Buns fresh meat very tasty 
1,Drive thru was great
1,Their smoothie is next to heaven 
1,Always a pleasure to dine in good service
1,Fast and friendly Usual McDonald s quality
1,I don t eat at McDonald s but I do UberEats deliveries I love this McDonald s because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesn t have one This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there 
1,It is just minutes away from the pier many homeless people inside and you should take good care of your belongings It is clean but employees barely smile and cold due to holiday working hours I guess Had the double burger cheese and oats meal which I do not complain It is thanks giving holiday 
1,The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald s out there The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio They had the munchies I guess 
1,It s McDonald s 
1,Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance Food is prepped fast and staff are professional Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens I always take out from here and go to the beach Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there 
1,It s McDonald s by the pier McDonald s In the wee hours only time I go it can be colorful with the occasional altercation conflict but they have security Never had a issue there Order my food from the kiosk wait p u eat while I walk home and later wish that I didn t order to sandwiches 
1,It s a McD s fast food cause you don t have a lot of time when you re going somewhere Convenient place to grad a quick breakfast in the morning with all other shops still closed
1,It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at McDonald s Since Covid the option to dine in was removed Remarkable 
1,It s not clean and there are no offers but still ok Bathroom is usually clean
1,Lots of homeless people inside
1,To be honest I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D s for its coffee I have to wake up pretty early so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at am With that being said I will also say that because of Santa Monica s influx of homelessness over the years this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons Most are nice and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time however it s the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome The staff tries to placate situations but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday So if you can t handle talk be patient and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day the don t go here I don t need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing Bye 
1,This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier about block away I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends Do note that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily this McDonalds in particular gets very packed So please be kind to them they are trying their best to get your food served 
1,It s a Nice McDonald s due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the pier also people talk about beggers being near it but I didn t see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs
1,The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of is because overall I don t eat McDonald s or fast food However the one day that I did go to Santa Monica I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean The staff there were also very hospitable friendly and alert I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside I haven t had McDonald s since so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it Everything was okay okay with me 
1,Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and outside Remove that you get stars Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the restaurant Food is your typical McDonald s no change there They offer a bathroom but its a busy location Overall I d return with caution 
1,There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff but it seems that the issue has improved My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons They always get our order right and the delivery is seamless 
1,Very nice very clean Saw a guy come in who looked homeless and security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out It was kind of impressive yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn t all there Also the men s rest room was very clean however I d prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser I like to use paper towels to touch these things especially the door when leaving 
1,Fine it s always busy place
1,Good McD centrally located and quick service 
1,Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces homeless and everything that goes with that the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean service helpful and food good as always We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids no this extra that and each burger was put together exactly as ordered 
1,No different than any other McDonalds except that it s in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach It s surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast Seating can be an issue on very crowded days Over all good experience and not too bad 
1,They always have a lot of staff in hand specially on the week ends and at peak hours You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier This also means that there will be homeless there as well I like to live and let live so I don t mind sharing space with my fellow man With that said there is security at hand at all times Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonald s with a smile You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location 
1,They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled and they also gave us the actual orders we bought All in all they were pretty fast workers They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier I understand that it s not always going to be clean there because frankly there s not much room to clean there most of the time If I could give stars I would 
1,We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner The food was always made correct and fresh however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult No condiments are self serve the security guard has to let you into the bathroom sometimes hard to find a table 
1,I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals the burgers were cold and tasted funny they ate the fries and of course really liked the toy inside out of today mediocre 
1,It was crowded Unfortunately they don t do refills here 
1,The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite you can eat on the patio but not for long 
1,It s McDonald s cheap sustenance to keep on going We had a couple burgers and fries and I can t complain they were alright when the price is taken into account It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times The restaurant itself was pretty clean what you come to expect from a McDonald s 
1,We only eat halal food The fillet o fish is a good choice for us but the price is high Though it 
1,It s a McDonald s it didn t disappoint I got another one supersize And that s what I wanted Fade Out on the floor back back back to get a bag over there balcony Exactly what I wanted no surprises 
1, midnight this place is packed and they bring it to your table 
1,They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked for here or to go The service was fast I had my food ready before I could fill up my drink 
1,The restaurant was clean and orderly Food was prepared fast and made properly Everything was decent 
1,Eco friendly flatware restroom is locked up tight transients Employees are dismissive and arrogant Not courteous and refuses to answer questions about food products ie what s on a cheeseburger answer would be Cheese bread But the food is hot and fast 
1,The food was fast and good for McDonald s The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building The entrance smelled like urine 
1,They literally almost got the entire order wrong would not come back ever My family got two deluxe s round egg small decaf coffee med coffees with sugar and cream We ended up with packets of ketchup no bread for the muffins in the deluxes no hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time Also there is another McDonald s in my area that s pretty lame This place has a better service overall sort of long review sorry 
1,The recently advertised real meat patties for their Quarter Pounder burger more or less was what you expect same great taste same great value though it did not fail it however didn t feel any different from their other burger options on their selected menu Would I get it again Yeah why not Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second third and maybe fourth Who knows really Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks 
1,Its mc donalds what can i say
1,The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in Due to its proximity to the Pier there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store 
1,Lines can be long but service is friendly Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait The employees do practice good customer service 
1,It s an interesting location for a McDonald s and this property must be super expensive Aside from that it s a good enough place and I give it stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonald s to begin with If you re on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets this is your spot 
1,They get you in and out fast I love this McDonald s adjacent to the beach and the Metro Expo Line
1,The order was done really quickly and that was greatly appreciated because we were in a hurry We bought McNuggets and they tasted amazing Every one 
1,The food was good I mean they put several pickles in my yummy burger The fries were perfect The wait was a little long 
1,Chain Criteria Clean Interior and or Restrooms Fast Service 
1,I love the CA McDonalds have McChickens we only have Hot N Spicy in AZ The service was fast and the food was fresh and cheap It was also accurate no missing items This is how fast food should always be 
1,Good as every other mcdonalds but only one big difference A lot like a looot of homeless people here I like it because of the staff but too many homeless that and this time the resroom run out of seat covers lol
1,Ruthlessly expensive McDonalds food because it s by the beach but they take the mobile order deals Security on site though not too pushy People seemed friendly enough 
1,The cheapest place to eat at when your by the pier literally If your on a budget Mikey Ds serves you at its finest The problem is they dont have the dollar menu anymore and this place can get packed during lunch hours 
1,I go to every McDonalds I can This one is quick service and good food But please note that it gets a little crazy at night time This is a very busy spot next to the pier 
1,Always a nice and friendly place to go Fast and with good prices as always It will be there when you need a food 
1,Was a McDonald s You know what you get The store itself was clean the service was prompt and the people were nice The automated ordering machines were a pain to use though and we gave up as it was unresponsive
1,Kind of confusing as people were just standing everywhere and one of the workers looked lost herself Once it cleared out some t hmm ings settled the food was accurate and warm 
1,This is my go to McDonald s now with automated cashiers ordering is quick and easy nice and clean courteous employees it s just getting better 
1,No bad location easy to find service is kinda slow at times though 
1,The food was great Service was quick They forgot napkins and ketchup for my to go order 
1,It s McDonald s fast and cheap and admitted one of my guilty pleasures Sometime I just want a cheap hamburger even if I could grill up a gourmet at home 
1,It was too busy There going put the door I suggest going to the one of the many local eateries they are all much better than here
1,What you expect from McDonald s cheap unhealthy fare Went here to grab a late night bite Got my order for a mango banana smoothie wrong but replaced promptly 
1,The place was busy but the food came out fast and was acceptable for a McDonald s Overall not too bad 
1,I like the way you order your food Its all automated which is great The food came out quickly 
1,I mean it s a McDonald so you know what you get At the same time the prices around the place make you wanna come here 
1,Nice area would go again 
1,Great food great costumer service very very fast with order turn around less than minutes way less bums there
1,I like McDonald s I like ice cream coffee humberger fresh fruit 
1,Certainly nothing fancy but cheap and reliable quality As far as the golden arches goes This location was better than most 
1,Note there is no drive through on this location The staff are very friendly and very fast 
1,I really appreciate the fun my Grandkids are having So I just unwind at McDonald s with a big soda ice cream and a burger At a good price 
1,This is honestly a pretty solid McDonald s for how much BS they have to deal with They have late hours too 
1,Not too bad of a location Busy no drive thru but fast friendly service 
1,I liked the service and the food was better than my local McDonald s 
1,If you don t stop at this McDonald s after the beach you are weird 
1,I love this place I like to see the people who enjoy their time 
1,Toilets can get manic and get big queues as it s right near the pier everything else is what you expect from a typical McDonalds
1,Very pack at times but staff are still giving orders 
1,The food that they sell here is great you should always get the hamburgers fries and the soda drink coca cola is best
1,Typical MacDons You CAN go in here and just use the bathroom for all my folks looking for bathrooms you don t have to pay for around SM 
1,The people there were kind of annoying but the food did look like the the commercials or close enough Nice place close to the pier 
1,Fast and clean what else do you ask from a McDonalds Certainly not high quality food 
1,It s small and packed but they were pretty fast for the food 
1,Fast friendly but not so much if you re homeless
1,Good hot food but a lot of homeless people they have security though 
1,Clean and organized mcdonald s with friendly personnel Attention The Restrooms are locked for public You need to ask 
1,Very clean and fast Despite the occasional homeless begger asking for change 
1,Not a bad McDonald s at all considering how busy it was A lot of good people watching here 
1,The service was adequate and there was a lot of seating space for the group I went with 
1,It was okay but they only had apple pies when I wanted Other than that its aight

1,Fairly busy staff friendly 
1,Always ridiculously crowded but quick and good service 
1,Slow service and terrible location It s like homeless central in there
1,The attitude from lady who delivers the orders to the tables unacceptable She trows the ketchup

1,The staffs were very friendly and our food was good The facility was clean They were very busy and our food was was good However our food was not delivered until about minutes after we placed our order We wanted to try McDonald s pasta I 
1,This McDonald s is one of the nicest and coolest McDonald s I ve ever been to It is a two story McDonald s with a play place and an arcade They offer non traditional menu options such as build your own pasta ravioli pizza cake cheese cake etc it truly is a one of a kind McDonald 
1,World largest McDonald s Food is the same they have pizza and pasta too The seating and ordering process was quick and easy but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge Our burgers came in fairly fast minutes or so but pizza took minutes from the time when we ordered it I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza Honestly this worth a single visit especially the playground if you have kids If you looking for a quick bite I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service 
1,This place is huge Large play place and fun arcade Pizza at McDonalds Yup we tried it Overall it was delicious and had great flavor although the crust was a little thin for my liking Overall fairly clean floors were a little sticky Bathrooms were clean 
1,This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table Only stars though because the food was cold when it arrived Probably would have given it stars but I got extra nuggets in my happy meal 
1,World s biggest McDonald s They serve Pizza and Pasta here I tried them both To be honest I didn t know what to expect from the pasta but I guess i
1,Very cool place got food on menu you will not see at any other McDonald s The pasta was cool but not the best Service was really good Had a good time 
1,Overall a good experience at this McDonald s the largest in Florida if not the country a very big place I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade area just ate and ran But additional options here pizza and pasta I had both and both equally good A little longer wait for those items so expect the additional cook
1,Well I guess I checked something off my bucket list I didn t even know I had The WORLD S biggest McDonald s How cool Pasta on dishware at McDonald s Yes please The place was a madhouse but worth it for the experience It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didn t let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area I know kinda mean But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous Definitely worth the visit even for just a cheeseburger And KUDOS to all employees this place is NUTS AND a drive thru Bless y all 
1,This was a great experience I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to The pizza was really good Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy but other then that I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando
1,The food was quality but service took a while I liked the food a lot I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both I also got a large fries a burger and drinks Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places Only con I d recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it s like this 
1,Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest McDonalds I mean it s just a fast food place right Wrong The place is huge brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations the everyday McDonald s kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade playhouse and more sit down area The pizza was only after toppings It was a small personal pie thin and crispy b
1,Great place for the kids playground and playroom are great I recommend you the min for just play card while waiting for your food it can take longer that other McDonald very busy place 
1,Had to check out worlds largest McDonalds pizza s took minutes to come out Customer service was nice didn 
1,I went two times during my visit at Orlando the first one I took a pizza it was s great experience have pizza at a McDonalds franchise the cons is that took about min to my pizza get done Second time a ordered a Deluxe Crispy Chicken and it was great fast service nothing to complain 
1,Kids love mickey d s so we had to stop by You order from a kiosk and wait for your number to be called Thought it was weird they didn t have the hot n spicy but it was pretty cool just to be there They do have pizza and pasta but we opted to stick to the originals we know Game room is small but again it s all about the experience Don t expect much and you won t be disappointed 
1,The Play Place and mini arcade on the second floor definitely make this place The food is actually brought out to you which is nice and there are some novel items on the menu but it s still just McDonalds with higher prices Is definitely worth stopping at if you have child that likes the Play Places 
1,Massive size diverse menu and captivating ambiance Arcade games play area and free Wi Fi add to the fun Minor wait times during peaks Highly recommended for MCDs enthusiasts The mcpizza and other menu items I have never seen before The prices are higher and there are many many people here Cool to visit and see 
1,Arcade and play place on second floor was awesome This McDonald s offers pizza pasta and philly cheese steaks just to name a few Ordered from the regular menu however and fries were meh Warm but soggy There was a employee walking by asking if everything was ok which lead me to realize I didn t get juice for my happy meals which they retrieved 
1,Playplace was large and year old had fun Nowhere for disabled year old to sit while brother played Nowhere to put drinks while playing without occupying eating tables Not enough tables for guests Long lines at kiosk Kiosk menu needs easier ways to find special items Many people asking for help Over a half hour looking for parking had to park at another business and walk over Needs more space Staff was all helpful manager was friendly Italian section interesting to watch restaurant was clean Nice experience only needs more space 
1,Clean Was surprised to see pasta and pizza as our local McD s does not have these items The arcade is upstairs you can take an elevator or the stairs It is really nice 
1,Since I m known as Jimmy McRib I had to take the opportunity of visiting the world s largest McDonalds even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each way Anyways this place is huge and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and pasta I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib too but it was not to be even at the world s largest McDonalds This was an incredibly busy place even at pm There are tons of local hotels and tourists were everywhere with most of them speaking a language besides English The restaurant wasn t the cleanest but that had to be due to the fact that they are open and always busy To my surprise the bathrooms were very clean and nice Anyways what is unique at this McDonalds Hand dipped hard ice cream Multiple stories with an arcade and playland upstairs A pizza and pasta section A big fish tank in the lobby It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and traffic but there was plenty of parking The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was cool I wanted to try the pizza or pasta but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger which I ordered through the app It was pretty hectic inside with tons of kiosks for ordering which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream but it was a nightmare as nobody was working that section and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us But they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was good It was definitely neat to see this McDonalds but it was a bit too busy for me and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the day 
1,This McDonald s is the biggest in the world There s levels to this McDonald 
1,The play place is still shut down due to COVID but the kids still had a good time For some odd reason my son LOVES going to McDonald s even though we only go maybe twice year and only on road trips We had to stop here and he was thrilled We did the min arcade card don 
1,Really cool McDonalds with different menu items then most Had a cheese pizza blue Fanta slushie and a mcrib combo Pizza was actually pretty good Store is big but hectic and not the cleanest Service was super fast easy self checkout and brought to your table Young fella delivering table orders was hilarious and a great employee 
1,McDonald s tourist trap Yeah but worth it McPizza was like a really good gas station bowling alley pizza The alfredo pasta over salty but otherwise no worse than frozen stoffers or big box store brands The Pesto basil was actally not bad not Bronx NY italian by any means but yeah gross Playplace for the kids the video games are not bad same money drain as any arcade 
1,Was greeted with a welcoming fish tank as decor and friendly atmosphere from the staff although it seems like most things in the menu were sold out Food quality unfortunately did lack the food does look visually appetizing but lacks in taste and quality Would recommend stopping by if you want to experience something new 
1,You re paying for what you re receiving This is a crowded McDonald s Keep that in mind lines are long and the food is the same as any other McDonald s except for the specials here pasta pizza and desserts People are trying their best so don t expect a star restaurant treatment If you have time and a limited budget this will fulfill your curiosity P s Always check for deals they always have discounts 
1,I think it s the largest in the world stories MASSIVE kids playground the serve pasta dishes on actual plates a real pizza oven scoop able ice cream parlor elevators as well I think it s a test kitchen type of thing Throngs of people Also automatic trash compactors 
1,This Mcdonalds is two story with a playplace Therr is also an arcade on the nd floor We used the kisk to order the food and and sat on the nd floor someone delivers Seems to be steady all the time 
1,Biggest McDonald s in the US Has an arcade and huge play place upstairs You can buy pizza pasta cakes etc here The kids loved it The staff was friendly Our order was right Even has an aquarium If you re hungry and want to see it its worth stopping 
1,Fun to try McPizza and McPasta Food was better than expected Of course the ice cream machine was down The place is huge 
1,This McDonald s is really nice Super big and offers other foods other then McDonalds lol It also has a second floor with more seating and a arcade section for fun They offer a tap menu option and table service So once your done ordering thru the self tap options you grab a number and have a seat We ordered our regular McDonald s food with the addition of a strawberry and banana waffle Which was bomb I did feel like the store was a bit dirty But it was probably cause it had a rush After we left it calmed down and the employees were cleaning It is on the more expensive side We ordered two Mcdoubles which we had a coupon and applied it large fries a small drink and the waffle The total was bucks It would have been Lol
1,The place is great The service was fine I wait for more attention I m from Colombia therefore We are more service and in the attention to clients Today We had to pay for the spacy Bufalo 
1,This McDonald s has a pizza and pasta area made to order and is very good but like any McDonald s it s hard to find the staff that are willing to work in such a busy and crazy place You cannot order with a real person inside You have to order from a kiosk and they don t always get your order right or forget something There is a drive through that is kind of like a race track and wraps around the building with or lanes and if your order is wrong oh well so be it Just take it or leave it There is a huge play place for kids and a second floor with an elevator 
1,Came on a Sunday afternoon on March break and I hated every minute of the experience My family however had a pretty good time so I didn t bother to explain to them the downsides of mas
1,Very big place i had to order from a kiosk but I m used to it and fine with it I ordered three things came out to about very decent i ate inside and in about minutes a worker came to my table with my order The customer service was very nice and up stairs they have a play place for the kids they also serve pizza pastas and cake here so it surprised me but overall great experience I will say because of the play place there is naturally a lot of parents bringing their kids so it can be very loud 
1,Largest Mcdonald at the word they said very good beside regular manu they have pasta pizza and steak sandwich s on subs also big arcade on the secound floor went for dinner place was really busy thats the reason i didnt take pictures from the inside 
1,Been here a couple of times kids love it finally tried the pasta it was surprisingly good
1,So i don t usually give fast food more than stars but this place was comically huge Giant arcade and large play area There is even attempt to make like omelette and stuff I even saw brick stoves like you would see pizza cooked in Did I mention a fish tank It did take a while to get our food and it was typical McDonald 
1,A fun place to go to maybe once or twice Went during the weekend The ordering kiosk lines were slow because people don t know how to use ordering kiosks McDonald s was out of pasta but they had pizza I was bummed because I wanted to try the pasta I ended up ordering a regular meal you can get at any McDonald s Seating was easy to find and the tables were clean Employees were helpful The arcade upstairs seemed pretty cool and definitely unique We didn t play any games or play in the play place I enjoyed seeing Mac Tonight playing the piano Next time I ll get some dessert 
1,Being local we try to stay away from the busy tourist places but this McDonald s is so big we really don t mind We like the fact they bring your food to your table and the employees try their best to keep this place clean The customers tend to be rude and push people or not say excuse me in this establishment 
1,Did you know McD in Orlando has a Philly cheesesteak Yea they really don t it s a big mac minus the sauce on a hoggie roll But good job trying new things 
1,Very average McDonald s experience overall Was cool because of the whole largest McDonald s bit but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere Took a while to even get the opportunity to order then food took a while to get to us which is understandable since it was so busy Ice was out in soda machines Not a very clean place either Pizza was alright Very dry flavorless crust pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven the oven could be hotter If they put like more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better Onion slivers were also just onion chunks Not a big deal just a little misleading But what else you expect from a McDonalds Food is a little pricier than the McDonald s I m used to as well Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere 
1,Biggest McDonald s in the world has special menu items pizza and pastas don t sleep on the ravioli bolognese Being it s the world s biggest it was a madhouse inside some kiosks down completely some just the payment part not working Overall food was good inside was a zoo but you can only get the special items inside 
1,Was told that we had to come here because it is the biggest McDonald s in the country It is huge there is an elevator that takes you up to a kids playplace and full size arcade They also off menu items that aren t on a normal McDonald s menu like build your own pasta and pizza
1,Because it is the largest McDonald it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket list It is very crowded very noisy a lot of kids of course They have pizza coffee and sweets beside the regular menu I think the staff works hard and as fast as they can In my opinion the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run flawsly The self order machines two or three didn t work so it added to the slow service Upstairs is an arcade game room You need coins It is very stuffy and even more noisy But as I said a place to visit one s in a love time so you know you did it 
1,This McDonald s has a huge amazing inside playground and arcade nd floor Beautiful fish tanks for the kids to look at while you are ordering It does get a little loud when the kids scream Plenty of tables for everyone Order downstairs and take a number they bring it to you Super nice when you have difficulty walking g like I do However drinks are downstairs Handicapped parking in front of the doors An elevator to the second floor and handicap tables with half booths upstairs My neices love this McDonald s 
1,Kids had a great time Hard to find play areas these days Great selection of arcade games Our cheeseburgers were cold however i saw more customers opt for the pizza and philly cheesesteak 
1,It s a huge McDonald s and has a nice choice of other foods that are Not your basic options 
1,So many unusual items Got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the ham and cheese french toast CRAZY Really enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend everything stop here The chocolate cake was pretty good too 
1,biggest in the world but still a mcd s the golden arches doesn t really do anything impressive i mean disappointment is kinda expected Walked in with no expectations I like that they have other food besides the regular burgers was impressed by the brick oven pizzas they were putting together we tried ordering breakfast ALL DAY but they were out of so many entrees like OUT not sure how you run the world s biggest McD s and not have stuff on hand at in the afternoon It wasn t super crowded Love the self ordering kiosk that s what you get for demanding hr for fast food wages Love even more that you can order from your app and just go pick it up at the counter Our fries were as expected from the golden arches the top floor has seating and an arcade the main floor has a lot of seating areas with plenty of window seating for it being the world s biggest it really didn t seem THAT big also they could have more of a variety of entrees foods dishes that is different from a regular neighborhood mcd s just a thought 
1,The service was very slow compared to Ireland and our order was mixed up even though we ordered on the self service machines The soft drinks were flat but otherwise no complaints American McDonalds burgers taste quite different to Irish Mcdonalds 
1,Nice big McDonald s on the International Drive The place was packed and too noisy The service was fast though and had decent food Will try again for sure 
1,It was cool definitely check it out 
1,Place is great for kids Usual McDonald s food but cost a lot more Better to go to a different McDonald s location to eat and Epic just got play and fun 
1,Great location very cool place to visit especially if you have kids Very cool that they have pizza and pasta Even omelets and waffles too Play area is the coolest part With arcade too Only down side was that the restroom were fu king gross Mens restroom over all tho it was great 
1,If you re looking for an atypical Mcd s the This is it Housed in the heart of International Drive this world record holding burger joint holds its own Two stories of seating a GIANT play area for kids and even a little video game section You don t just get burgers and nuggies here they have stone fire pizza pasta and cake It s an experience for sure Just a heads up you ll be paying a slight premium for the whole event Not much but you ll notice I d suggest ordering on the app and getting a discount 
1,We went here for my sons th birthday and he loved it Dress for warm weather because up stairs where the play place is It 
1,Came here to florida for work purposes and brought the kids Food was good overpriced but good and came out quick We came around am on a sunday I was happy to see they have the bagel sandwiches back as texas doesn t have them yet My boys played on the playground and the arcade Half the games didn t work but would take money off the card anyways so we just played the ones that did work so we could get prizes and leave Crowded and loud but fun 
1,I went here with a lot of expectations so I m a little disappointed However its pretty great place still This place is like a mini Chucky cheese married a McDonald s and its give birth to this biggest McDonald s Its floors with limited parking They do have wood fired pizza I wish I tried its The pizza looked good The staffs were super friendly One McDonald s employee went around asking how everyone was doing 
1, Pizza is from a Fire oven turned out good Philly Cheesesteak was also very good AC upstairs was struggling was pretty hot when we went Kids sweatted up a storm from playing at the play place which was also warm We did not have any issues finding seating have tables for big groups on the nd level of us 
1,I lived in fl all my life and this McDonald s location is the biggest I have been It has an upstairs downstairs for seating Upstairs also has a game room I didn t order anything because the prices seem higher than normal That was understandable because it s located in a tourist area I just amazed of how it look inside Seems like a great place sit eat with the family 
1,This was indeed a large McDonald s The entire upstairs is an arcade and playground maybe It comes with the problems you might expect in the world s largest McDonald s Still it s the WORLD S largest McDonald s The upstairs bathroom was real small still I have been and you haven t The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes was excellent 
1,Great time Never though i would eat a stake and egg breakfast in McDonald s It was a bit overcrowded for my liking Other than that Food was hot food was cooked to order Would go back again 
1,Be prepared to spend per person Clean bathrooms also Staff is friendly and helpful with the ordering Upstairs is wild and crazy 
1,Apparently it is the biggest McDonald s on Earth It is a story building that offers specialty cakes pasta and custom built pizzas Also it has a huge indoor playground for kids as well as the arcade room The Food We tried pizza and surprisingly it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra I would rate pizza points out of The Ambience This McDonald s is clearly a touristy family place which is good Also the service was pretty quick given the location 
1,This is the first McDonald s I have went to that creates pasta and pizza Believe it or not it taste good I m super surprised my dish come out delicious However everything come with a price It is a bit expensive than every other McDonald s since one plate of customize pasta or coal customized pizza can cost from depending on what you want It is easily for people to spend at least at this place I don t recommend their philly 
1,Large very busy McD s with a larger menu Food was a bit slow and it was hard to find a table Pizza was surprisingly good 
1,This is the World s largest McDonald s by square footage They have play place arcade and unique menu items like pastas salads Belgian waffles a bistro menu and dessert options you can t find at any other location Don t fear because they still have the fries chicken nuggets and 
1,So it is my birthday today and I wanted to try something I have never tried in my years A McDonald s pizza or as they call it a McPizza there are only McDonald s that serve them The Pizza and pasta were truly awesome We did the ordering from the kiosk and proceeded to our seat Everything was great except they didn t bring my husband s latte So I asked the gentleman that brought the food to bring the drink We were nearly done by the time we received it and it was incorrect After eating we went to get the correct one and the manager had an attitude and basically filled a small cup up with milk and handed it to us Overall the food was great The only reason I am giving stars is because of the issue with the drink We will be back but next time we will get water 
1,A really fun experience So many food options It was easy to find vegan friendly food The quality of food was about cafeteria quality but it still beat having to eat something considered regular food at this place They have a large indoor play area an arcade fish tank a sundae kind of station The kids loved it 
1,Neat experience but dirty restaurant We did come around pm and they were very busy Husband did love the pizza 
1,Yo first time here This joint got a play area I m talking arcade style on the second joint 
1,This location is huge for a McDonald s It has play area and arcade games It also offers customize pizza and pasta menu in addition to the usual offering Prices are slightly more compared to other locations which is justifiable given the amenities it offers I saw some reviews complained about slow or bad service I didn t notice that on my visit Overall I think it worths a visit if u happen to be in the area 
1,Food is okay just like another McDonald s but they have pizza service is okay but always busy building is amazing for kids with the playground and arcades 
1,surprisingly fast for such a large busy location After time at Disney it is nice to have a more affordable meal 
1,It was good but very crowded They have extended menu from regular Macdonald which I recommend to try 
1,This places was crazy busy Took minutes to get our food The play area was a fun experience 
1,World s biggest McDonald s it is really cool you should see this when you re in Orlando stories tall ginormous playground and arcade and they have special menu items I got the brick oven pizza that was cooked in an actual Brick Oven it was actually pretty good and cheap but the service is very slow it took them minutes just to give me my food 
1,The kids had a blast Very hectic and tons of folks are there You order at a kiosk and then they bring your food to you Our food arrived in an orderly time Although the fries were cold and we had to send them back The kids enjoyed the play area and game area I recommend you let your kids wear socks or bring some Otherwise they run around the nasty floor barefooted when they are on the playground They also have an icecream and dessert area 
1,I m a very picky eater and for me a once in a while treat is great and saying that there is no vegetables in t
1,Nice McDonald s with bigger menu selections like pasta and pizza separate dessert area play structure game room and decorative items like fish tanks paintings of McDonald s characters floors of dining
1,We finally made it to the Biggest McDonalds It was a Thursday so it was busy but not packed Line moves quickly and they bring your food to you The play area was fun with lots of places to climb but our let down was the arcade The selection was ok and some were out of order Not to mention you don t really rack up too many tickets Over all it was fun food was fresh and it s McDonalds so totally kid friendly 
1,It was a fun experience but our food was cold and our fries were not salty I d go again because I would like to try the pizza and pasta 
1,Very cool McDonald s with arcade play place pizza and pasta Pasta was actually pretty good Kids had a great time at the play place 
1,This McDonald s is very impressive It s clean modern it has a brick pizza oven and fresh pasta options and a pretty decent arcade on the second level And they bring your food to you Now I ordered a maple dijon bacon bistro burger and it arrived without bacon and Dijon sauce They brought it to me on the second floor and left before I noticed the error I was trying to figure out how I would grab all of my stuff and my kid who was excited about the play area go back downstairs get my order fixed and avoid a toddler meltdown when I noticed an employee cleaning up I asked him if he could get my order fixed even though I knew it wasn t his fault or problem and he did it happily He even gave my son a free cookie for the inconvenience AND waited for me to check my burger to make sure everything was right The customer service there was excellent The burger was still lackluster 
1,Still maintaining a indoor Playspace with arcade on nd floor Elevator access available and restrooms on both floors Delivery for food to tables both floors ordering on first floor only Double drive thru lines Open hrs
1,The customer service was okay and the service was a little slow but the food was probably the best I 
1,It s a story level McDonald s and they have many kiosk they would like you go check out that way but still had a guy on a register They have all the usual food and them they have pizzas you can order and pasta I got the tortellini Alfredo with chicken It was very good It s just insanely crowded
1,Nice place for kids but need more staff to keep up with the cleanliness of the place Nats flying around by trash cans and over your food is horrible Floors were horrible to walk on 
1,This is by far the biggest McDonald s I ve ever been too the st level has seating the registers to order with a person or you can place your order in the kiosk machine the nd level has an Arcade 
1,This is the largest McDonalds I have ever seen massive two story second level has elevators and stairs and features a really nice play room for the kids and arcade room as well They serve omelets cake cheescake different flavors of icecream hard serve woodfired pizza and pasta Staff was friendly they even feature table service 
1,We have always visited this branch when we are in Orlando As always food prices in this particular location is very expensive You can not get the morning deal of compared to other location in South FL It is for chicken biscuit and if you want to add a hasbrown it becomes and since you like to add a drink you have to add for a sweet tea Small size hot coffee is Still a wonderful experience since they had the place renovated We experienced our first kiosk ordering here when it was first introduced 
1,If you re ever visiting Orlando why not go to the biggest McDonald s in the world It is definitely really fun The pastas and pizzas were surprising
1,This is obviously the coolest mcdonalds I ve been to An arcade little bakery pizza pasta and a cheesesteak Plus all the mcdonalds food you know of I m not giving it stars because after waiting over minutes and seeing others get their food and not have gotten my order yet I had to go up to the counter and ask for it But the cashier was nice gave me some extra nuggets for the wait and all was forgiven I recomend checking this mcdonalds out at least once in your life Its definetly not like the one you are used to Plus open 
1,One of the best maccys I ve seen We don t get them the same scale here in the UK However during our visit on the middle floor there was female drug addict camped out in the disabled restroom Who went into the ladies restroom and blocked a member of our party from leaving and asked her for money Fortuntely another member of the public went in and out party member returned Other than that Really liked the place
1,Worlds biggest Micky D 
1,Fun place Biggest MCD s in the country Service is fast and friendly Love the extra food selections Kids really enjoy the arcade upstairs as well 
1,Nice organization overall clean enough The food took a while to come and my order needed a lot more salt than it had The arcade area was fun You can pay dollars to have unlimited credits for minutes not so bad you can t earn prize tickets with this unlimited mode though 
1,I visited this McDonald s only for the fame it has What makes it special is the new menu items pizza and spaghetti Also the arcade and the top floor is very nice My food didn t take long and the restaurant was very busy specially on Thanksgiving holiday 
1,Same mc McDonald s new experience They offer foods not on the menu at other McDonald s such as fruity pancakes and pizza The best part however is being able to order breakfast items all day It also features a second story with playplace and odd singing moon character that plays piano Parking however is hard to find even at the best of times 
1,We ve been here multiple times and always thru the drive thru Today we actually ate inside for lunch Today the food was pretty good Previously it was ok to good occasional messed up orders Regardless we will continue to come back 
1,Good McDonald s usually connect to a Travelwise gas station but due to covid it s no longer connected Additionally there is no dining in You can only get food through the drive thru My drive thru order is always correct I usually have a special order of no pickles and it s always correct 
1,I went through the drive through at this Mc Donalds and had no issue with ordering However it did take unusually longer to go through the Drive Thru To that end the food was hot and fresh However they did overstuff the bags with my order As when I got one of the bags ripped and my food fell on the floor Lastly if you go to this McDonalds be sure to double check if the bag is overfilled and ask for an additional bag if you need it Besides that everything else was fine 
1,One of the slower McDonald s but attached to the gas station for convenienc
1,It s McDonald s not a Michelin Star restaurant Service wasn t the best then again it was pm on a Saturday Fries were lukewarm McFlurry was watery and the cashier needed an attitude adjustment But if you re in need of a late night snack after a night out look no further 
1,Store stays pretty clean and food is made fresh 
1,They have started to give a full slice of cheese when you order one on Filet O Fish sandwiches and that was a real problem before in which they used to give half of a slice extra This is a fast location and food is consistently fresh so now this location has the highest rating I ve given a fast food chain yet to date Kind of never thought I d give McDs a star but I did 
1,Food was good price point for fast food is too high For two people For quality and size of fast food meal I should have gone to cracker barrel 
1,This location traditionally has fresher tasting food than other locations however they forget sauce for the nuggets pretty frequently 
1,Good food Pretty fast considering lunch rush I would give stars had the manager not been to rude to myself other customers and employees not to mention his inability to pay attention to orders Perhaps he forgot that drinks are not in the lobby with the current health risks even though he had no problem shoving the lids and straws at me 
1,Carmel Frappe should have it own line
1,I always get mobile curbside pick up and usually they take less than minutes for the order even if there s a long line in the drive thru 
1,They had a pretty long line for the drive through when I was there but they got through everyone pretty quickly 
1,Slowest McDonald s around But the games and modern layout make it easy to pass the time Particularly like the touch screen head to head games Play them with my daughter and we have a blast Food delivered to the table for those eating in the restaurant Bathrooms are clean and there is easy access on and off the for those traveling through and needing to grab a quick bite to eat 
1,Little slow getting order out but it was nice hot and fresh 
1,Just too much in a little bitty area need bigger lines and some type of space I get in side a convince store but it s still alright
1,My kid s happy meal didn t get a drink nor toy 
1,The McRib sandwich was great and what a deal for Of course a Mc Donalds stop is not complete without fries Got a small order watching my carb intake but should have gotten a medium or large Love the fries 
1,This is a very busy McDonald s attached to a gas station at a very busy intersection The guy at the register had a very strong accent and was difficult to understand at times nice but hard to understand We were fortunate to sit next to the same guy we just saw panhandling at the intersection 
1,This McDonalds is pretty solid they are usually quick and there is never a super long line but occasionally they will leave out the sauces for nuggets and it 
1,Everything we ordered was fresh service was good and atmosphere was comfortable 
1,Usually pretty good occasionally they get backed up but all in all a solid location
1,Order was correct I guess I will have to get used to eating in my car Drive thru line went quickly 
1,Quick Service and great location I always stop there for my apple pie treat to myself And it s great when dipped into a cup of ice cream 
1,It s McDonald s Service was fast and friendly Can t give it stars because it s McDonald s and unless staff is rude or the place is dirty it s hard to mess up McDonald s
1,Good McDonald s Usually get the orders right Bigger orders just need to check they don t forget anything and of they did they fix it right away 
1,Ordered the homestyle chicken sandwich fries and a strawberry banana shake It was hot and fresh and good for McDonald s 
1,Love McDonald s Still like to get kids meals to play with toys LoL Plus you can still special order food Just be polite
1,Service was fast however it was not to busy I think they did a average good job 
1,The food was hot and really good The service was fine as well
1, Nuggets for is a classic deal great for an extremely unhealthy night time snack
1,Exactly what you d expect from a McDonald s Consistent food speedy service the place could use a cleaning though 
1,Always clean friendly people
1,It will always be one of the quickest cheapest places to go food there is good for the price
1,McDonald s is classic great for kids great employees good food for sure

1,ey that boy who was working the front register this morning n the whole day y all need to give him a raise br
1,Fast service Clean bathroom Good customer service Bilingual staff 
1,The employees here are very commendable very fast attentive and very nice as always So far this is the fastest serving McDonalds drive thru i have experienced Courteous employees and going extra mile to deliver your orders saying sorry when took some time Service was quick atmosphere was good and looks like the employees were trained good and happy in their place I have been coming to this McDonalds for about a year I have always had great service and happy interactions with the employees Hot and fresh Quarter pound burgers are delicious along with their great fries and drinks 
1,They can be very slow when you go inside to order but the they focus more on the drive thru then the people inside But overall it s okay and maybe it depends on the day that you come 
1,Shoe store was nice and clean all the shoes are in place customer service was terrific the problem that I have is that it does not go up to size and dress shoes for women
1,Long lines but that s McDonald s for you when they are selling crack I mean two all beef patties with special sauce on a sesame seed bun The problems lies when you have a big order at the drive through You must hold the line to make sure you got everything you ordered because you dont want to have to go inside or go through the drive through again Quite a dilemma 
1,Ordered my food Just your typical McDonald s The special orders were all correct Slight wait and the manager gave me two free holiday pie desserts for the hassle Excellent customer recovery and service 
1,Completely serviceable Not the best but not the worst location by far Could use with a few sectors hands keeping the tables clean But food is hot and fast 
1,McDonald team work fast and efficient very few McDonalds have short line they get the job done Thank you Mary P
1,I m only giving them starts because the corporation sucks But I ve always had great experience with the employees 
1,It s McDonald s literally no more and not one iota less We all need a reliably bland calorie rich meal from time to time Ronald Mac I salute you 
1,Food was good Check your fries prior to leaving Mine were cold 
1,Was busy but service was nice Touch menu needs update couldn t order my Frappuccino with extra caramel 
1,This is my spot on the regular Tonight they shorted me three orders of fries and sometimes the sweet tea is too sweet 
1,The place is clean they mostly get your order right Serve us fast But it can be really crowded 
1,I ve loved this place since I was a child I miss the play place They need to make them everywhere as a requirement I am glad they brought the happy meal boxes back 
1,They can handle a custom order but the wait time is usally longer than it should be at this location 
1,Don t have to wait for a long time the walk up line was fast and my order was right the first time 
1,Can 
1,Friendly customer service through drive thru service was great Friendly pleasant staff offering fast service as well 
1,Most have no idea the historic significance of this McDonalds Back in the s ALL McDonalds restaurants were drive ins meaning no indoor seating You ate in your car or standing outside Oak Park had an ordinance that stated no drive in restaurants but Ray Kroc founder of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home town So in order to get approval to be built THIS very McDonalds agreed to install stand up hi top tables inside so technically you could eat inside It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and eat As I recall it opened in around or so It was a VERY big deal around the area 
1,One of the best McDonalds near Chicago Fresh Food 
1,McDonald s is McDonald s they re famous because every restaurant tastes the same good quality fresh hot drive thru experience
1,Courteous service and good food It was not a long wait in drive thru 
1,Food was hot and tasty No long wait at all

1,Cool for the kid of mine
1,Good hot food served quickly kinda pricey 
1,Friendly staff food good

1,UPDATE This is a solid restaurant My food has always been made to McDonald s standards They have very busy times which is in part due to their location on the highway in a restaurant area but also because they are a solid restaurant Their curbside service gives you an estimate of your wait which is appreciated and your food will be delivered by a friendly employee an improvement from my previous experience My only complaint is that it s obvious they make your curbside drink far earlier than your delivery because they come to you partially melted see the slush below They identified my 
1,We wanted to dine in Nope Drive in line was huge and took a long time First order of fries was cold even with the crazy long line Didn t make any sense to me They fixed the fry issue IMMEDIATELY and with kindness Here s the deal the staff there HAD TO BE OVERWHELMED They better be making an hour at least 
1,After being disappointed with my experience with Dave and busters we stopped by this McDonald s The line was a little long but I did no mind It was worth the wait They were very courteous and the food has always been 
1,Pretty modern and clean McDonald s location with a nice outdoor seating area when the weather is cooler Workers are friendly enough and the food came out quick and as expected 
1,This was a mostly great experience The drive thru is a bit slow but the food was fresh hot and delicious No reason to have speaker lines when the pay and pickup windows are slow 
1,Drivethru was atleast vehicles went a lot faster than I thought Was a disappointing to find out that they dont sell salads anymore at and springdale area location 
1,Online order food wasn t fresh other than that I was ok with the food
1,It was a busy Sunday t
1,They have a great deal on drinks and since I don t eat meat the main reason I ever drive through is to get a drink and sometimes an ice cream cone This time the ice cream machine was broken It seems to happen with some frequency I guess they serve lots of shakes and ice cream 
1,It was great I had a birthday party there for a sibling The staff was really nice they gave us some extra happy meals because they messed up our cake we are the great time we had cookies and had a bunch of fun I d recommend coming here it was nice 
1,The food is alright but the don t add all your when you order so yeah I had to 
1,Its McDonald s not sure what to expect Take about the same when I get a crazing for soy burgers I want to try that experiment my self where you set out food from there and see if it denigrating or stays looking the same I ll find out one day 
1,Whenever we are near here late at night and want junk food we stop here but both times they have forgotten one of our fries It s annoying but not enough to turn around for 
1,Service v good employees at the griddle wear gloves employees are neat Restroom needs to be more clean Clorox solution for cleaning have to go Slippery floor with that nasty clorox 
1,Fries were kind of cold and a little under cooked Everything else was bomb 
1,Great food go by in the afternoon or evening though the morning shift dislikes the manager and it shows She s a good manager the people seem to not like their job or something 
1,Busy but prompt Parked and give give me jelly or ketchup But everything else was good 
1,Love the fries and drinks
1,The food was fresh There are two employees that are rude Everytime Maybe they are in the wrong field of employment
1,This chain should figure out it s drive thru method it s so third world country old fashioned they need to turn on the brain power and figure it out 
1,Stopped in at the spare of the moment to get dozen chocolate chip cookies and they were fresh and fast with my order Thanks 
1,Didnt give my drink in a timely manner and then forgot to bring the straws 
1,McD s is always a good place to eat no matter what I get
1,Very usual McDonald s because you park your car at a station and your food is brought to you Very nice staffa

1,My meal was handed to me before I could fill my drink and made perfectly Keep it up

1,I stated at a near by hotel This was the only thing around open late Only the drive thru was open The drive thru took min When it was my turn to order the cashier skip my lane and helped car from the other lane first 
1,There s nothing special about a big Mac I m not sure about this location but I ve definitely paid for a big mac meal Better at better prices elsewhere 
1,The fries were hot but barely had salt on it I couldn t taste any flavor
1,The girl taking our order was so incredibly nice She was helpful and cheerful and really got our day off to a great start The food was great and and it was done quickly 
1,In contrast to the many radical reviews this location was slick modern new clean Small downstairs because the kitchen is upstairs At p m there were about to times more cars lined up to get to the drive thru than there were people inside My food was fine nothing too positive or negative This IS a McDonald s not your family BBQ 
1,It s a newly renovated McDonald s has a very skinny drive thru so be cautious It s advertised as hours but isn t always open Have gotten food here several times since reopening Every time food has been hot and tasted fresh Customer service was surprisingly good Will up date in the future Trying to eat healthier you should as well Fa t food hould never be a daily thing Warning 
1,Had to order at the kiosk Good was fast and freshly made great for a quick meal on the go The interior of the place was very sterile No menus above the counter This location was just remodeled too not liking it at all 
1,A bit of a long line in the drive thru but the workers where moving the lines along They friendly at the windows 
1,Hot fries and standard fare Can get very very busy in weekend nights at the drive through 
1,I want to return to this McDonald s some day when the pandemic ends The lobby looks cozy to dine in 
1, hrs Isn t that enough Hot coffee Comfort food 
1,It was clean It was not too crowded The items I ordered were up fast It s a place to go when you don t have a lot of dough and not a lot of time I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just need something fast 
1,Decent McDonald s newly rebuilt quick drive through Sometimes food s been under heatlamp a bit long though 
1,Little bit of a wait but that s pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces The location didn t look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street It s McDonald s not a chic fil a you get what you pay for
1,A little small for my taste It is one of the older McDonalds so it doesn t have outlets The staff is great though There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice and it seems like he never has a bad day None of the staff as far as I have seen discriminate against homeless people Their humanity gets them the extra star 
1,Beware of the parking it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded if you are backing up you may have to wait or even worse get hit by a car backing up I actually saw this Not a big fan of McDonalds food but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar Service is always great 
1,This place has clean restroom The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park The dining area is not so big but clean The cashier was friendly and welcoming I like that breakfast was served all day 
1,It s McDonald s but not too bad considering they just completely remodeled the place The kitchen is now upstairs and it has smaller foot print with a bigger more organized parking area 
1,As far as McDonalds go this is a pretty good one Know how I can tell Fries are always blistering hot I live near this McDonald s and I don t have to force myself to come here even though I pick up food or times per month Stuff that s supposed to be hot is hot stuff that is supposed to be cold is cold As far as the service goes here s the amazing thing mostly millennials are working here and the service is still good If you are in the area and hungry I recommend this McDonald s but please don t tease the Millinials they get spooked easy and stampede Thanks 
1,It s a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it s a good facility they don t run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald s do so that s why I didn t give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they re good
1,McDonald s is awesome get the app with that you can get cent large iced coffee 
1,Small but very busy McDonald s location with a drive thru They offer their standard menu and service is reasonably fast They do have extra attendants working the drive thru during busy hours to try and move traffic along 
1,The new design is futuristic Self order no register sleek design compact Impressive 
1,It s McDonalds If you don t know to check your bags before you pull away then you ve never been to a fast food restaurant before The service was friendly and the new menu items are fun to try Seriously though it doesn t deserve one Star reviewing I ve been to some true one Star places and this isn t one of them 
1,This place has a small parking lot but the inside is generally clean and cool The soda machines Diet Dr Pepper tastes a little off other than that the service is good and the food is well put together 
1,They know how you make early morning coffee taste yummy to the last drop 
1,I used to work across the street so I would go there quite often Usually quick On occasion I would wait minutes to get my order Otherwise good service 
1,It was very busy for the time I came in I had a minute wait on my food
1,I guess for a McDonald s it deserves stars because it was perfectly a normal McDonald s but it is still the lowest common denominator when looking for food so Don t expect more than McDonald s but it was clean and the food was hot 
1,It was McDonald s The service was fast and friendly The food was good and most importantly the FRENCH FRIES were HOT NOTHING WORST THAN COLD FRENCH FRIES 
1,This is my go to McDonald s and it 
1,Always buy my ice coffee here usually it s perfect but a few times it taste really watery or over loaded on cream milk or even vanilla flavor
1,The standard McDonald s menu the staff is friendly the restaurant is clean They do get busy and sometimes they get a little behind but not a lot 
1,The new rebuilt mcdonalds looks nice also drive thru lanes now 
1,It s not a great place but it s not too bad of a McDonald s to just go in have a quick meal to eat there or take it with u
1,Nice customer service free Wi Fi and they even have outside seats small parking lot though Overall good experience 
1,Place is too small Once you order I waited for my food and I really didn t have anyplace to stand without getting in someone s way 
1,Drive through is faster than walk in Food is good for McD s 
1,Very friendly fast counter personal always willing to make sure your order is correct
1,The Place was okay excepting the bathroom i know it s difficult have that clean and beauty but could be better conditions
1,McDonald s in North Hollywood very good customer service you got to deal with the homeless a lot right there though a good McDonald s to go to
1,Fast and efficient 
1,always cheerful and always helpful great service the only downside is OVER RUN BY HOMELESS PEOPLE all the time 
1,Would have got five stars but they were out of ice cream cones Boo 
1,Its McDonalds Drive through is narrow and has a sharp turn but other than that one thing it s your standard McD s 
1,It s ok if you want something fast the people are friendly 
1,This is a busy McDonald s so there is generally a wait at the drive thru and parking lot is tight 
1,Los Angeles Great service and fast
1,Just had my ole standby snack Dbl Cheeseburger small fries and a small coke s High School Lunch 
1,Fast drive thru Very efficient 
1,Anytime before pm is hit or miss pm to am is always quick and hot 
1,Makes it easy to grab a quick bite Self ordering inside
1,Clean store with fast service Had the mcgriddle and wow
1,The same old the food is bad for you but it s cheap if you do it right and don t get sucked into the marketing 
1,Fast Happy meal Accommodating and friendly
1,Sometimes busy Some days drive through accept only cash 
1,Most convenient McDonalds It can be busy and you might wait a little longer 
1,fast drive thru considering it was rush hour
1,It s mc Donald s The man before me backed up the toilet and an employee let me use the women s
1,This is a good one Clean and easy to park 
1,Get food but forgot several items that were bought and paid for unfortunately was too far away to go back
1,Open hrs Line for bathroom at pm but only place open

1,The prices for fast food are crazy for a large sweet tea McDonald s corporation is abusing customers for profit 
1,Gave me the wrong breakfast sandwich this time Ordered a sausage egg and cheese bagel and they gave me a bacon egg and cheese bagel Still tasted good though
1,Service was quick despite longer line Order has always been correct Staff is friendly 
1,This was a good McDonald s I m not sure if it was 
1,To be clear the rating of stars is perhaps generous I debated between and stars but I ate at this McDonald s pretty late so I ll assume the staff was just tired and ready to go home The place was fairly clean and service wasn t terrible but it wasn t stellar either They originally forgot the cookies my friend ordered and when they did get them for him the didn t have all chocolate chip so they gave him of those and sugar cookie I understand that but rather than just telling him Hey we got you of those and of these they should have asked Since we only have chocolate chip can we give you those and sugar cookie That s just polite Also the ketchup was out even though they clearly weren t busy All this being said they took the order quickly apart from that were friendly enough and got the food out fast without any mistakes apart from that If I m in the area I might stop by but the McDonald s in Marlton is much better 
1,The manager Ikea is awesome she provides great customer service she make sure that all her customers are taken care of properly and I just love her friendly friendly Behavior to make sure my food was hot and it got to me quickly I m happy to see that they are allowing people to eat in now I thought it was rather disturbing closing off the dining room area so I m very happy about that part
1,Excellent new children s play area Very inexpensive kids meals We were served within minutes of our order going in Not a lot of people kids there which was even better Just wish the menu was a little more adult oriented 
1,I mean it s McDonald s I typically try to stay away from McDonald s but it was the only place open in my area at pm And no body has sprite like McDonald s usually The fries were fresh Definitely should not have eaten the beef will definitely have your stomach doing jumping Jack s Lord I bout died on that plane ride back home trying not to traumatized the other passengers and if the sprite doesn t taste like battery acid then it s not McDonald s my sprite was definitely missing the acid
1,Drive thru line was pretty long Put on my mask and walked in Ordered and item was in a bag ready to go in min New pastries are wonderful 
1,Newly renovated it s all shiny and new I like the self ordering kiosks they re putting in McDonald s speeds everything up once you get the hang of it The chocolate shake had both vanilla and chocolate I liked it that way but they really should get that fixed Going back for a bacon big Mac 
1,It s McD s Service here is always good but quality is variable It s usually good but sometimes it s off Bun is stale fries are cold Employees seem a notch above usual fast food Update Oct Last three times I ve been my Quarter Pounder bun has been stale and the never frozen patty was over done and served way too fast to be cooked to order Disappointed that their quality is going down hill The never frozen pound patties are worlds better than the frozen ones when they re cooked properly 
1,The staff here albeit like most McDonald s is packed with teenagers However I ve found them to be respectful and polite I ve never had an issue with an order or service 
1,Has a nice playground for the kids Very clean on the inside Workers are very friendly The bathroom could be a little cleaner and more appropriate for children to wash their hands 
1,Very clean 
1,I have not been on the inside of a McDonald s in years What a great surprise It had a minimalist vibe technologically up to date was clean and the service was quick 
1,First time at this particular restaurant I found the food hot and the counter help friendly and efficient 
1,Standard McDonald s food staff unusually attentive and polite Seating area clean and well stocked Bathrooms a little less so Parking is abundant 
1,One of few times I will give a McDonald s stars I hade different employees ask to take my order inside 
1,The food was hot best hot French fries 
1,Drive thru line was a tad long and I had to wait about minutes for fresh fries nonetheless staff and service was great
1,Good food
1,Wish breakfast menu had croissants and longer hours on weekends 
1,I love the fact that you can order an Egg McMuffin without the muffin when you re following a low carb diet 
1,Drive thru and mobile ordering only The drive thru had a double lane which made things quicker 
1,Nice clean upbeat friendly place My kids really enjoy here especially the play place 
1,Food was good
1,I was starving so i woofed it down Had the big mac n just the right amount of sauce
1,Vour typical above average mcDs

1,This location has a fun indoor playroom area The play equipment always seems to be clean and well maintained I take my two year old granddaughter there occasionally and she always has fun The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screen interactive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it Every time we re there she stomps on it to try to make it work She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work I

1,Hey McDonalds please go back having the dollar Apple pies I miss those apple pies that you can reheat in the microwave and eat with vanilla ice cream Please consider At this location the driveway was long but fast It was just the drivers was taking their time moving up My order was right the workers was respectful Yes I will go again The food was hot

1,My experience here at the McDonald s in Newark is ok the place is decent the restaurant is really clean and the vibe is new and updated I got the new shamrock shake McFlurry with Oreos it was very sweet but it was still very good the employees is ok but my on
1,I ve been here many times and they ve never messed up my order which is a better track record than most McDs I ve frequented Above average for a McDs but they should work on keeping the fries fresher often old stale and gross Few things better than fresh McD fries and few things worse than old ones

1,This McDonald s has great customer service but the fries weren t the best I ve noticed the fry problem at other MickeyD s seems to go along with the omnipresent employee shortage 
1,Ordered triple burger with no ban Like this place cause ot is new and inviting But crew don t have time to take care of the tables Wish all customers take care after themselves Keep this place clean So much was invested 
1,I got a delicious Quarter Pounder For they added lettuce and tomato With medium fries and drink my meal cost 
1,My experience with this McDonald s was a good one I did not experience any poor treatment from the staff In fact the young lady who took my order was pleasant and helpful No attitude no acting like she had better things to do she treated me very well even joked with me a bit because I wanted a shake but the ice cream machine was down for cleaning My order was correct and EXACTLY what I wanted and was done in a speedy manner given how busy they were Only reason I didn t give stars is because I didn t get my shake LOL
1,It 
1,This was a convenient place to stop and grab something to eat on our way home from a movie They were busy and I was thinking it would take a while but they had employees who knew what they were doing And we were able to get our order within minutes and they got it right 
1,Not bad service They were fast not super friendly but not mean The food they served me was actually pretty well done They did give me the wrong sauce I asked for though 
1,Ok here complaint You serve breakfast bisque bacon egg and cheese But you don t serve bacon egg and cheese bagels after pm I find that unacceptable it s on your menu and you are a business that is seeking to make a buck You seek to have positive numbers on your income So why it is such big deal that you can t serve me a bagel after pm I m the customer and put money in your pocket You need to rethink your way of treatment of your customers I can buy anything on your menu at anytime 
1,This parking lot is congested it s hard to move around on this lot Plus I just witness a horrible case of road rage McDonalds need a better layout to avoid all of this dangerous nonsense However I had and ice cream cone that was absolutely delicious Yum 
1,Typical Mcdonald Decent tasting food and reasonably priced They performed as expected
1,I m not a big fan of McDonald s and this restaurant didn t change my mind The food was the same as all McDonald s service was good and their prices were reasonable as are all McDonald s I ve ever visited They are consistent 
1,Nice kids working here But for fries Really 
1,It s a McDonalds The food is consistent and delicious if you like McDonalds 
1,Good service only thing I didn t like was no milk 
1,Good food for people on the road and they also have a IHOP I know right just not In the store just a little blocks and you ll see it it 
1,I walked in and I was the only one there at p m on a Wednesday Ordered Quarter Pounder and large fry and took forever to get it but it was hot and fresh
1,My opinion is that Management and staff do not speak English well so Customer Service is not at the level it should be I did have to wait longer than expected but my food was fresh Can t complain about that Thanks
1,Went here for lunch it was very busy Customer service was great and food came out quickly 
1,The drive thru always makes me feel like I m going to run into the wall 
1,They always missing my mac sauce 
1,Clean fast service In a pilot so its a one stop shop if you need gas or otherwise
1,Well stocked good service truckers mark up everything marked up cent

1,Same as any other McDonald s except they were super busy and no one was available to take orders if you re paying cash for a while One of the coffees we ordered had grounds Food was hot and ok 
1,First time visiting this McDonald s location The staff was nice the food was good Service was fine for a fast food place Nothing phenomenal or out of the ordinary to report Pricing feels amazing compared to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center s across the street prices for their food 
1,Walked All the way from Luxor for dinner and before food I always used the restroom But there was RESTROOM AND IT WAS OUT OF ORDER Come on McDonald s Please Fix it Thank You 
1,Typical McD s Food is exactly what you d expect Same with the service Atmosphere was a little unusual but it s Vegas 
1,Parking is difficult but other than that it s McDonald s The fries will always be the best 
1,Lovely staff and amazingly quick service for my big order Impressive quality and great nuggets with sizzling hot fries The place is big enough and very clean However I noticed the pop machine wasn t working properly and spills cock around which needed a look Good experience overall 
1,A very nice place You can feel at ease and enjoy quality time with your family and friends 
1,For am the staff was pleasant the service was fast I even used the self ordering kiosk l Where it s at there is no lack of homeless panhandling so if you need the restroom an employee will let you in and don t be surprised if it is below standards or seeing someone sleeping at a booth On a brighter note The line at the drive thru window moves swiftly and there is a bus stop along the sidewalk for the North bound Las Vegas Strip bus 
1,All around the inside is Fair but need to check air vents its dirty All Soda Machine need to be constantly watched because when its busy it gets nasty and dirty floor looks clean but need more cleaning and the windows all around need to be cleaned and of course the frame Very Impressive One As far as the overall look Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat here Customer Service is Very Poor Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their training And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they don t like to be friendly and all showing how great and wonderful to have a job that lets you interact with people This is one of the most questioned part of Hiring Are a People Person Are good or happy to be around People ETC The Outside Area is good Actually better than good Food is very good but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the top I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or not So you have good location ok dining area staff not satisfied not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or problems This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE 
1,As McDonald s goes it was that However the food genuinely looked like the picture It was clearly made to order Wish I could ve used the restrooms I guess they didn t know that you can block off every other sink urinal stall or whatever It was the last free standing McDonald s with parking southbound from Vegas Bottom of Vegas Blvd 
1,Was on vacation and location was very convenient Over all nice and clean and great customer service Ordered the spicy ckn sandwiches to be exact and NOTHING like back home Overcooked with a pinch of sauce Burnt and dry as the desert Definitely would ve said something if I was dining in I visited more times before I left Didn t complain about ckn sandwiches and ordered different food it was just OK Must say they are stingy with sauce
1,Great service One rude employee seemly didn t want to perform her job duties 
1,First time in a McDonald s in Las Vegas had to travel to the far south end of the strip It s nice despite it being more remote Stopped in on my way to the famous Las Vegas sign it s clean good service despite it being Thanksgiving morning Its a good place to come before you get to the hairy crazy part of the Las Vegas strip 
1,Food service and price was great gave stars because you have to go to the register and get a pin code to get in the restroom I didn t have time to wait in line to get the code Other then that everyone was very mice and great service
1,Priced for thr Strip The Manager needs to not yell at the employees in front of the customers Wow Nice ladies who work there Have some respect from management Went around am on Friday 
1,It was McDonald s You know what you re going there for and it is always quick and acceptable If you are expecting a linen table cloth and candles you are in the wrong place If you are expecting quality food at a good price and rapidly you found McDonald s 
1,Standard McDonald s food except I notice they give half the bacon that other McDonalds I ve been to with hotcakes It s a convenient walk from Mandalay Bay when you re just tired of spending a ton of money and waiting in line for a mediocre breakfast at the hotel The ice coffee is very weak so stick to hot coffee if you need the caffeine boost The bathrooms are locked so you ll have to ask for a key 
1,This McDonalds location is okay The food is always tastes great I like how they have WiFi here So I was able to eat and get my work done The staff here are nice I like this environment and commend this place 
1,This McDonalds is like home and has a good down to earth vibe I would of gave five stars but the hang ups I have is the homeless people in the drive thru constantly begging Its just getting really annoying Like I wanna order my food and eat without being bothered I hope the get a little more mindful of that Also many times I order something and they often forget to put everything I m the bag I know this mcdonalds gets a lot of traffic and is busy but those are the only pickles I have 
1,Very busy Staff were ok Didn t have lemon for my tea
1,I eat here for lunch a lot and I ve never seen a ton of homeless people here I see one once in a while outside but that s it Food is served fast and fries are hot I love it here 
1,Nice service by the employees very satisfactory Some of the people seemed to not have to go anywhere Taking up places to sit for families but quick and pleasant 
1,Got the big breakfast and it really hit the spot Didn t like it that the employee wasn t all that helpful about their menu availability at am But the breakfast was good 
1,Ordered inside to go It was very busy Took minutes to get my order 
1,Same menu as every McDonald s everywhere and the quality is just fine The big advantage of this location is that it s just off the strip so it has more normal prices and it s not as crowded 
1,We stayed at the Tropicana and didnt want to pay each for breakfast so we went here It was a minute walk it s across from Mandalay Bay and encountered homeless men along the way but it was worth the walk Food and service were excellent and the prices the same as other McDonalds The place is new and clean The is also a Subway in the strip mall Highy recommend if you can stand the heat durind the walk 
1,Wish my food would have been a lil hotter and a lil more fresh but hey that s fast food for ya 
1,Fast clean efficient Everything you want from a McDonalds A great place to stop for a snack before venturing in to the pricier parts of the LV strip 
1,Longer wait time in drive thru But good service
1,Standard for a McD s I didn t see any child booster seats or high chairs for the young ones but like other reviewer said you don t have to go into a casino where people are drinking and smoking a plus for me 
1,For a quick meal And to get out of the cold or heat It can be very crowded at certain times No Wi Fi 
1,Had a egg mcmuffin and coffee it was good
1,McDonald s is good place to eat but they might get some orders wrong but it s still ok cause they have this thing where they are making food from all different McDonalds in different countries
1,Generally good service but the last few times I ve had to pull ahead on the drive thru line and wait an unusually lengthy time 
1,It s a McDonalds so you already know what to expect However while hotel food is wonderful this is a welcome break from the noise and prices when you need it 
1,Definitely not as bad as all those low raters are saying If they feel that way why would they keep coming back 
1,Understaffed but friendly min ticket time 
1,Very busy but staff was very efficient For high traffic fast food it was Clean also
1,Food was okay They also have kids play area which kids would enjoy

1,It s clean for starters Other than that just regular McDonald s no dollar menu though
1,Considering the small location the staff delivered prompt and courteous service 
1,Service was quick but it seemed like the person taking my order was distracted
1,Always great food for when on the road or for a healthy quick meal 
1,Good food and price but flies are flying around your food 
1,It s cool except the waiting for the key to the bathroom part

1,There was a wrap menu that is not found in Japanese mornings I think it would be even better if it had vegetables in it 
1,American experience Not too much difference with France 
1,Breakfast specials are good The sausage burrito and sausage McMuffins with eggs are freshly cooked Been wanting to try their spam eggs and rice but during our visit their rice cooker isn t working so t
1,This place was serving good quality breakfast items at good prices The speed of service was good but not the usual experience I have which is super fast However it was a popular time of day There were spaces available although many people didn t clean up after themselves so you had to do this yourself It 
1,When I arrived at McDonald s it was very crowded and a little less clean Also the machine was broken so the waiting time was longer Umm 
1,It s fast food but for a quick meal after the beach or a reasonable price breakfast it s hard to beat within walking distance from hotel
1,Limited menu here especially the breakfast items Food came out pretty fast though and was good 
1,Very busy location because literally everything else is touristy and expensive Food came pretty quick considering how many customers there were
1,Standard mcdonalds but with a spam egg and rice dish 
1,I went here for my morning pina and I found it pretty delightful The creaminess was slightly thinner than I was hoping and there was a palatable butternut squash undertone that was confusing my palette Nevertheless not bad for franchise pina I ended up going to the Laylow a few blocks away and ordered coladas who were quite accommodating as we rolled dice in the corner 
1,Stopped here to get my daughter some dinner fries came out hot and they were packed in nuggets were good and Oreo McFlurry was good my daughter was very pleased as another McDonald 
1,I bought quarter pounder w cheese and Haupia pies we get hone and i have apple pies because they did not say they ran out of Haupia Pies Sad 
1,It s better off ordering ahead on the app but there is still a wait for food regardless minutes for plain sundae 
1,I visited a McDonald s restaurant when I learned about the Hawaii local menu I wanted to order a taro pie but it was not available I even went to a different McDonald s but they still didn t have it It seemed like they no longer make it I thought I would like Saimin but the soup was just way too salty Hubby ordered a regular meal and it tasted the same as what we have in Canada 
1,Came specifically for the Guava cream pies and they were amazing 
1,It s McDonald s You know what you re gonna get Lobby was closed at the hour we went but there were seating options out by the beach so that was fine Its nice to have somewhere cheap and quick to eat late at night because everything else that was open was sit down and much pricier 
1,As any other McDonalds but here your have a view over waikiki Too many weed smoking young people who travelled to the islands to become homeless
1,Good spot for being in a busy spot Be prepared to share space with the homeless here though Nature of the beast Food was hot and the order was on point Cleanliness of facility was lacking Didn t appear to be a dedication dining room professional They d probably need a few at this spot to keep up 
1,Actually not bad for a McDonald s 
1,It s a McDonalds It s always busy and the staff do their jobs but no one s in a rush in Waikiki 
1,Right across from the beach it s a really nice location Great to grab something quick to have on the sand The fried pies especially the taro kind Are far superior to other McDonald s pies 
1,Food was good my tip is take away eat across the road at beach staff are friendly and efficient Shame the dining area has a negative atmosphere 
1,In terms of fast food in this particular area this McDonalds was my go to choice and they have some unique menu items occasionally such as the McTeri which I liked 
1,Nice place beach front For quick snacking Front view from facilty
1,The service is quick and the workers are friendly Never had any issues here Only kindness Love McDonald s because the food is tasty and the prices are right In Hawaii they serve a local breakfast with Portuguese Sausage and Rice The Ice Coffee is only if you use the deal on the app Comes in different flavors 
1,Just grabbed a coffee in the morning Bit of a wait but all good 
1,Very convenient and cheap place to eat Compared to other McDonald s this one has unique breakfast plates 
1,Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Ave Long line in the morning for breakfast Staff friendly and they can will deliver to your table which is the only reason I gave it stars Complaints homeless person racked out at one of the tables some tables smelled my yr old granddaughter asked me if we could move Nonetheless that was just one area so if you gotta go to McDonald s while visiting this end of Waikiki it s a good choice Picky s Tip there are self serve kiosks up near counter So if in long line check them out for some reason people were not using them Saved at least minutes and that s how you get table delivery 
1,Pretty long wait but consistent good food
1,Typical McDonald 
1,I eat here often It s always fairly crowded with tourists but the service is usually pretty fast There are no public restrooms but the dining area is kept clean 
1,Great location
1,Ordered Air Land Sea For being consistent of a Big mac Fillet O Fish Mcchicken then using the polymerization card on them That Wasn t half bad Service was fast but just can t sit down and eat which is what I was hoping after some surf and swim at the beach 
1,Great Pity about the homeless going through the outside bins for food So bad I brought a meal for one eating a discarded bit of pineapple 
1,Mostly the same as any other MDs fast eat in or Togo but remember it s next to the beach so it s a bit more sandy and humid 
1,South end of shopping areas Can be a bit crazy with people being it s location across the street from public beach
1,Located right on Waikiki Beach so it s usually pretty busy But my experience has been that the service is usually quick and the food is good Best not to go after hours or late into the night so be warned about that 
1,Hawaii Beach front McDonald s yes please
1,Try their Hawaiian style breakfast you can t get in regular USA I came here when I was on the beach for their soft served ice cream 
1,You know it s McDonald s convenient and not pricy 
1,Great clean environment Mask or optional no wait in line they have kiosk where you can order food and they bring it to your table for you 
1,Stopped in for a quick bite to eat I couldn t get breakfest because they said they stop serving breakfest at am And so I enjoyed a Big Mac with my morning cup of coffee and a ice water by the way its now cents for a cup of water 
1,The biggest seller to me is that it is open hours a day It helps to have somewhere to go eat when your biological clock is ahead of the local time and you wake up hungry The food was hot The drink was cold Service was great During my visit there were two vagrants got into an argument by the main entrance One parked his belongings and entered while the second one exited and began to rifle thru them A few cuss words and flung arms in gesturing and the situation calmed down The staff observed for an outcome prior to engaging so I am going to assume that this has occurred before and they got the handle on it 
1,Location packed due to being within waikiki as a result of this it is recommended to order ahead via the app Line can take minutes or more And can be stressful Burger packs offered 
1,Where else are you going to go to have a cheap breakfast 
1,Cheapest place to eat at the Ocean front I would grab a sandwich and fries walk across the street and watch the sun set they have benches You can t sit inside with Covid but why would you is you can have a view of the ocean while eating 
1,Ate here a few times don t judge me I have an year old Lol you know what you re getting with McDonalds and you knew they ll eat it Food was good Service a little slow due to coming out of COVID no doubt 
1,Really good service great option if you don t want to pay a lot for food 
1,No soda and asked manager about it and she replied there was none and walked away there was only Powerade and orange fanta
1,New kiosk to order from instead of standing in a line to order is a fantastic idea Accuracy of orders picked up is a whole different issue Constantly having to ensure all food ordered are in fact in the bag is quite annoying 
1,Fast service and completion of order pleasant staff all female nice location next to the beach Some homeless people in there with their belongings on the tables at far back Mostly keeping to themselves 
1,Great food decent service good prices Short wait so you 
1,Excellent well worth going to
1,Place was crowded but we got a table to sit at without any problems The only downside was that the machines where you could self order at the kiosk were all down 
1,Late night meal choice was ok Tried the new chicken sandwich was really good You could only do take out 
1,Kind of a bummer that they still don t have dine in available But it helps that it s right across from the beach so you can walk there and eat by the ocean 
1,Mcds is wat it is In some more trying times in my life mcds was literally a lifeline so I have to give them props Although eating only mcds will legitimately be fatal after a month straight do not attempt 
1,This McD s seemed to be shorthanded but worked hard to get it done We were told by an employee that eventually that McD s would be self order on those machines and all employees would work in kitchen No counter ordering How sad and so impersonable We want people to talk to not machines 
1,They have outside seating beware of the pigeons and tourists staring and beggars right outside McDonalds But overall it s McDonald We didn t wait too long to order food and it was packed with tourist which is cool because it s in Waikiki They also have a kiosk right word to order food if you don t want to wait in line Alot of seatings in McDees for groups or individuals No public bathroom though beach nearby though with lots of restrooms closed at night 
1,Busy but not as busy as the other breakfast spots Great if you want a quick meal on the cheaper side 
1,I don t know what is about fast food in Hawaii Maybe it s the relaxed lifestyle here but the time from ordering at McDonald s or burger King for that matter to actually receiving the good takes an awful long time The staff however are nothing but courteous 
1,Still great fries 
1,Good spot for McDonald s 
1,Good view on beach if you sit outside
1,This is quasi American BBQ It s still good though The restaurant is very clean and modern and the staff is very professional and friendly 
1,Usual fare and by the beach 
1,Not a long queue Food was excellent place was clean friendly staff although there should be more advertising on the outside as I walked past it twice not knowing it was there Google to find it 
1,Always hard to get onto Wi Fi Please go back to old app New app doesn t work half the time and the jumping fries are so annoying when you re waiting for connectivity 
1,Can t go wrong with an egg mcmuffin 
1,I like the Taro pie in Mc Donalds in Waikiki Beach Honolulu Hawaii They re mmmm good I brought some home too so my family can experience the good tasting Taro Pie from Oahu Hawaii 
1,Just the fact that they were obviously close to closing but still they where serving us with an appropriate amount attitude not only to say they were in the middle of the Waikiki beach and it was am 
1,Fast lines Breakfast was a bit different with serving rice with eggs 
1,A big shout out for their wifi Fast and consistent Able to get some work done while having a good coffee and a biscuit breakfast sandwich 
1,Limited food options and seating but the location and service was brilliant Especially like the fresh pineapple you can get on the side 
1,Like every other McDonald s except they have actual 
1,Wow first McDonald s in a long time that I have fast service Good job team 
1,Place was packed out Standing room only The service was very responsive in spite of the huge crowd we received our food quickly 
1,They forgot some things but the cashier s were amazing for the issue
1,Great options fast service even though always busy could use some work on customer relations however still a great place to pop into 
1,They had the items we ordered bc other times like ice cream machine wasn t working staff always friendly even though some customers can be rude 
1,Food was hot and came out fast despite the fact it was packed and there were a lot of orders
1,This McDonald s gets packed so be ready to wait a bit but it s relatively clean considering how busy it gets If you re here be sure to try the McTeri burger 
1, really good I needed some nuggets hot fresh and crispy french fries same yummy such a treat 
1,Long lines but moved very fast 
1,Fun place to visit Great menu choice but breakfast ends right on am 
1,Always busy check your order when given
1,Not bad for a McDonald s Great view customer service is what to be expected at a McDonald s Not too friendly but fast 
1,Good as always it was clean nice staff and fresh food
1,This is one of the best McDonald s anywhere but how does a sit down restaurant get away with no bathrooms and why would they want to 
1,Overall a good place but not as timely as I expect when going to fast food
1,One thing the sizes are smaller than mainland USA
1,Quite and not crowded place 
1,Always busy Need more casher 
1,No inside dining Grab and go Rice spam and eggs interesting and good 
1, hour walk in McDonald s in the heart of Waikiki Great staff that work tirelessly to provide exceptional customer service 
1,Fast service in a busy spot No bathrooms but one of the only places open when the bars close
1,Good service variety on menu Very clean and close to the beach
1,It was a McDonald s what can I say 
1,Some of the only moderately priced food around for pick right now Right across from beach 
1,Localized menu really enjoyed the spam and Portuguese linguica sausage for breakfast 
1,Clean and friendly staff and good location Good spot to people watch and enjoy a Frapp 
1,Nice location for fast food Double quarter pounder with cheese was on point 
1,Good food but the wait times vary 
1,Keep the place clean will make a good impression Nice people here 
1,It was open in the early hours and a haven for early travelers whose hotel is not ready
1,What can say It put the smile on your face 
1,Located in SASEBO harbour you can get burgers and cooldrinks etc this place is restricted to commons as it is located in the JFNS premises
1,Angela and manager elizabeth are great thanks 
1,Good location
1,Spam egg and rice rice was nice and soft egg a bid hard but it was great at am 
1,It s McDonald 
1,Good fast food good service 
1,You can never go wrong with a burger and fries

1,The food and service are always top notch 
1,Very clean Conveniently located Good crew 
1,Nice place to go very clean Friendly staff 
1,It was McDonalds breakfast nothing more say
1,Your average Mc Donald s Nice to get a cheap ice cream 
1,Better prices here than other Waikiki locations 
1,Fast service but got our order wrong Misstakes happen 
1,Very busy and usually crowded Excellent services 
1,Nice restaurant and very good coffee 
1,Not busy Good service fast 
1,Fries were hot Tide was out though 
1,Reliable place mo parking or drive through
1,Standard McDonalds in a tourist area Crazy crowded but still pumping out the burgers and fries 
1,It s McDonald s What can you say I guess the prices are higher than on the mainland but that s to be expected 
1,Super fast but no bathroom
1,I never eat at McDonald s on vacation except when there s Spam 
1,Sometimes you get tired of restaurants and spending each time Mc comes to a rescue 
1,Across the street from beach and hotel Odd homeless beach bumb lingers Harmless 
1,Good place four a quick bite 
1,Good well run McDonald s friendly efficient 
1,Fast service reasonable prices
1,Fast clean and freindly Would go back 
1,Nice seating area with a view of the sea 
1,Great place for great cheap food
1,This is a pretty automated McDonald s Probably one of the most automated ones I ve come across Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though Plus the area to stand was congested since it 
1,There are two lanes of drive through I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line When I got to the speaker they didn t bother to ask my order or order number They just kept taking people from the other line I know that sometimes happens they forget the order cars pull up But not in a row As they started taking the th car I pulled into the line and went to the window Food was OK when I got it But waiting minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn t cool 
1,Update Megan is still here and amazing as ever She joyfully asked if she could get us refills YES They offer refills again Yay You just have to ask in case she s not there Fashima and two other gentlemen working were also very friendly and even offered to help carry my food to the table Almost like we were at a real sit down restaurant the way they took care of us Thank you The only thing was that the quarter pounder seemed small and was overcooked and dry But we will be back Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering If give her stars we don t do refills here What So the funny thing is they are moving to have you order at the kiosk but you need to ask for the refills which they don t do because the beverage machine is shut down Just so you know when you go 
1,Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions Be prepared to wait mins in the drive thru even for a mobile order
1,Clean place with prompt and accurate service The chicken nuggets were delicious and crunchy We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait time The attendant confirmed our order no less than twice and I was given exactly what we asked The inside is clean as well as the bathrooms and has a lot of seating There s also an indoor play area for the kiddos In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers 
1,Very polite service Very clean One has the ability to self order Playhouse for the little ones Thank you Ileanna for the great coroner service Keep up the great work 
1,For a McDonalds I was pleased Ordered at a kiosk but they brought us our food to the table Order was correct and food arrived quickly Quite clean 
1,Same service like every McDonald 
1,It s McDonald s You know what you re getting You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in they re going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry There s no reason to give these service workers a hard time they re doing what they can Thanks guys Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it s always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes 
1,As a McDonald s goes it was great Fries where hot burger fresh and the pies where hot My only complaint is that the opinions where very limited 
1,Just a standard maccies I would prefer during the drive thru thst the menu 
1,Easy and fast drive through experience is always a plus
1,Great experience getting a late snack here tonight
1,This McDonald s usually ROCKS They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under min Tonight there was no line Also the inside was closed AND THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN SHUT OFF SHOCKER My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat So thats why we went Then they didn t put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot So I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag She said No we can t do that REALLY I have worked in the food industry for years I am well aware of what you can and can not do You didn t WANT TO You didn t want to value me as a person a customer or a future You didn t want to do your job properly in the st place You didn t want to apologize in any way shape or form I don t mind that a mistake was made I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with There are other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius 
1,The line was super long but I guess that s what should be expected when you get off the airplane at night and it s the only place still open Thank you McDonald s Despite the line the food was super good The crispy chicken sandwich was shared hours later slightly heated in the microwave and still great The McNuggets were even good Days later according to my daughter 
1,This location just recently allows you to dine in But there are like thirds of the seating unavailable The selfservice screen were not accepting card payments so you need to complete transactions at cashier anyways defeating the purpose of contactess ordering 
1,The service is good and food is fresh the only bad thing is just that its always packed because is a tourist area 
1,Best icecream ever vanila cone
1,This location has kiosk to place your orders only similar to New York then you wait for your number to be called to get your food Staff was very busy place was clean Not super friendly 
1,The drive thru lane was fast When I got the meal it was fresh and taste it good But the only thing the orange juice was warm and the coffee they put their milk and sugar but it was no sweet enough Also they forgot to give us ketchup 
1,I eat here once in a while when I m in a rush or just need a good fish sandwich Always good and fresh never any issues with the drive though which times out of is what I use Good place for fast food Drive through attendants are always quick and polite 
1,Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually broken I m pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we couldn t order any ice cream related products All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if I m ever in the area again 
1,Excellent and fresh hot food The inside is spacious and clean Friendly staff but I don t like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad makes it hard to customize your order and confusing I d rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald s But at this McDonald s you must order at the touch pad by yourself 
1,Friendly staff always busy but food done in a good time and always hot Restaurant kept very clean Plenty of parking A good McDonalds to be fair 
1,We came here twice during our visit to the area The first day I would have given them stars the service was fantastic and despite being extremely busy they gave great attention to each guest The second time however we came through the drive through and the service was terrible It was very early in the morning there were only a few other cars in line maybe in front of us and we were in line for at least minutes 
1,Employee was rude but it fine 
1,Kind of touch and go with this location Sometimes they re very attentive and sometimes they don t listen when you re trying to give them your order Late night is when I ve generally had problems with their service Otherwise they are pretty good 
1,Always a favorite McD s is still serving up all the favorites we were there for breakfast and had a short wait Alas no dining room availability at this location for now Very reasonable prices of course and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries 
1,Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins a large french vanilla coffee My wait time was approximately minutes I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed Again usually this restaurant is a five star McDonald s just not on this day 
1,Just stopped by my local McDonald s to pick up some breakfast items before going to work The th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food I can t believe how much I ve been eating at McDonald s the last years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the s Food is definitely better than it used to be and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts 
1,The food is always on the meh side Luke warm never hot and fresh even when it s busy and the employees are typically miserable 
1,New interior looks great This location has the new digital ordering computers The food came quickly and the staff were helpful Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasn t marked
1,Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults The food is your typical McDonald s fare with nothing special to write about They have a large parking lot and the bathrooms were clean during my visit My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays 
1,It can get tight getting inside when there s a delivery truck next to the store Most especially when you re going towards the drive thru 
1,This is one of the busiest McDonald s I have ever seen Very modern inside Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food At least it was very fresh 
1,Great workers were very helpful Eating area play area were clean Men s bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall Overall will come again 
1,Very clean and it taste as usual
1,It s a good place for fast food
1,I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased Even though I am trying to eat healthier these days I just can t stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly with a delicious sandwich 
1,The ice cream machine was actually working at this store Drive thru speaker was hard to hear No wait and quick service 
1,Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers
1,The line for drive thru was out to the street Not their fault it is not the first time Once I got to pay point it was quick 
1,Food was good don t like self order screens
1,The place was clean the washroom stalls needs repairs and it was clean but smells like urine big time Staff are friendly and helpful Thanks Rick Stasiuk Wetaskiwin Alberta Canada T A R 
1,This particular McDonalds across from Old Town is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my chicken sandwich meal Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything The strips needed more cook time my opinion so I brought them inside and made the request Now it s McDonald s you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it told the M O D and he says he can take care of it he just needed about mins I told him no problem and waited Now when I did receive it he made sure he gave it to me and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip of stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn t like 
1,We were visiting Orlando and I needed coffee Service was fast Staffs were friendly The sausage biscuit taste like freezer The coffee was good 
1,Read down place has changed a lot Getting to be excellent place to go Not good new construction is nice But understaffed Even at am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage Also the floors heavily littered Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant but alot of foreign domestic vacationers are just filthy They just drop food and wrappers everywhere When they are done eating they just get up and leave Host busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs More register coverage for the guests When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient I have had errors in my visits First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday s yes of them I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left The nd error wasn t caught till we where eating the Sunday s at home I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both Yeah it was only and some change but it was the principal I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home I always request plastic bag s for my food because the one paper bag they put my burgers fails halfway home The nd one is for the Sunday s Another epic failure ordered mcdouble no mustard and onions bacon mcdouble and mcdouble regular Received the mcdouble wo mustard and onions no problem bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail large fries ordered and received medium sized fries and of the smallest sized fries I ve ever seen guess they where kids sized fail The peice fry came without incident Less than of the whole order came correctly Getting better and better the manager Monique she runs a tight ship Every time I m in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing A great thank you for your great service Monique Wow place was packed Was able to wait just a short time and got my order Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff Must of been people in line only min wait Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks both with smile s on

1,Went through the drive through nothing to complain about But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there Too many fast food places in this area are like that though Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they d be happier Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too Yeah I think so

1,Tried ordering at the drive thru but the manager that was helping the drive thru operator apparently is unaware of the current bogo promotion told me I had to order to get the promotion so had to go inside and order thru the totens to be able to place my order including the promotion Besides that all clean food was good and service inside was outstanding

1,Nice stop after Disney World I did like it better before they remodeled 
1,It was very loud and crowded with kids goofing off and yelling Totally bad Can t even eat inside around the after school time

1,Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or tartar sauce due to a dairy allergy When I got to the pick up window they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected Unfortunately this happens constantly no matter what McDonald s I go too It s clear the prep team simply isn t paying attention to the instructions on the orders 
1,My family and i had come to Orlando for the weekend only so since Sunday morning we were ti head back to Miami We wanted ti get ahead of the traffic so we decided that we would order breakfast and eat as we traveled and McDonald s was our spot The lines were long but it moved pretty fast and we were happy I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great 
1,Tgey forgot us at the curbside pickup mins
1,Friendly staff Clean restaurant
1,I personally haven t had any issues with this location In the years I ve lived close by there have been times where the drive through was majorly backed up and something was clearly wrong But of maybe trips in the last few years I ve had good service and fresh food 
1,Good hot food A bit of a wait for a McMuffin at am Nobody else in line at the drive thru They had to ask the chicken for more eggs 
1,We stopped at McDonald s just for drinks It seems they were low on ice and 
1,Busy busy busy Prepare for a wait Location is good Restaurant is clean Employees are nice Orders are accurate Ordering Keosks are cool Well laid out up to date but prepare to wait This place is busy beyond repair Drive through stacked at least cars waiting with both wait stalls full For the last hour people lined up inside with of the kiosks in use Prepare for minimum minutes inside 
1,Food was decent Cashier had difficulties with card in drive thru saying machine was asking for pin Odd Large order but smoothies three quarters of way filled Filled but looked like ice and concentrate added They did remake it which turned out fine 
1,No wait in drive thru line They got the order right Fries were nice and hot and the staff was respectful I did not five stars because the girl at the drive thru struggled to understand me english was not her native language She tried though and it all worked out I got my correct order and in a timely manner 
1,I don t normally review McDonald s but this is a good one because of the staff right now You know what the food is like so no need to discuss you either like it or you don t There is a very sweet older lady that works here that is phenominal She likes her job is nice to customers and actually makes this place great I will be back Thi
1,Very busy usually fresh hot food fried typically don t have salt on them have been multiple times before with the same issue Prices also higher than other mcdonalds otherwise clean friendly employees fresh food
1,No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long Would recommend over McDonald s entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher 
1,Middle of the day and they were fast efficient and friendly the fries were hot everything was fresh
1,Only used thr drive through but order was correct and the food was good Busy unit given its location but the flow through the two lanes was pretty swift Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant 
1,The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met Tasha was the sweetest worker there The food was good and as isially good price They had some fancy new machines that had to be machines I was lost and couldn t get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy But overall good time okay food good people

1,Had to order on the tablet screen Then I was told to take a number to my table and it would be brought out They never brought it out and I had to go ask for it at the counter minutes later

1,This McDonalds is newly renovated with self ordering kiosk This McDonalds also brings to food to you table for all dining guest thats someting you normally dont see at anyother McDonalds The only issue was seating the new furniture at this restaurant is not kid friendly the table is way shorter than other Mcdonalds my daughter was spilling food all over the floor 
1,It s McDonalds The food is consistent McDonalds ordering is through the sel serve kiosks or drive through 
1,It took more than minutes to get the food they had girls at front including the manager The manager was working so hard and even with angry customer she had a smile on her face If I were her I couldn t do the job I think they need more people like her

1,I went to McDonald s and the service was friendly and brisk We got our food and were amazed that after all these years the food is still awful and our bag was missing a sandwich The missing sandwich was the highlight of our meal

1,The store was clean my food was fresh the lady that took my order was very nice and they had a big play area in the back 
1,Really enjoyed my breakfast this morning Hot and fresh Not a long line at all They were getting the orders in and out I really appreciated the young lady at the counter She made me a
1,Very very very slow service shame on this store it took minutes to cook a quarter pounder when on the paper only takes about minutes if you use the press minutes I worked in Boulder city Nevada as an assistant Mgr And we had minutes to get one order out and minute special orders so I don t get it but On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise don t even try it because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT 
1,The food would have been great if the tables weren t so nasty
1,I only buy things from the menu sausage muffin bundle and a sweet tea half sweet half unsweetened They consistently make the best tea out of the McDonald I frequent 
1,Its McDonalds The place is remodelled Gone are the Zoo themed life sized animal replicas on thee inside 
1,It s a macdonals so food is alright It was clean and loved the jungle decor thats a nice touch Only thing was the baby changing station the table opened outwards instead of longways like a regular one and it was leaning toward And with my o month old it was just a slide 
1,The Lady was a little rude over the speaker but face to face she was nice so I gave her a compliment regarding her hair But my order was right everything was not except the cinnamon roll that s why I only gave them stars please warm up the cinnamon rolls
1,Order was correct but drive thru took long
1,Great people fast not mess up your order real pros to The manager asked if my order was right He s was great nice polite and friendly 
1,Food is always fresh and hot 
1,The best looking McDonald s I have ever visited Located near the zoo Friendly staff and fast service 
1,Was good service would ve been better if we wasn t walking around a homeless person passed out on the sidewalk was strange for sure
1,Love the French fries The coffee drinks are great Excellent place for small children They do have healthy good for the kiddos Fun place to play Many treasured memories with my little grandson He s now 
1,It would be nice if the play place was open again but it s not so that was disappointing It s clean employees are nice got my order right 
1,This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites I like this location because the people are always nice and the service is always fast This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time 
1,I ve been going there for many years as they are close to where I live They are consistently decent They usually get it right it s normally fairly fresh it is McDonald s so They do make a darned good cup of coffee which is what brings me back usually I generally think of coffee when I think of Mickey D s 
1,This was a good McD They made a good product that wasn t smashed in a bag and thrown out the window They actually salted the fries that s a lost art anymore And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles Obviously a happy crew does better work 
1,I ve used the drive through only Service is great I love the outd
1,I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind friendly the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service but the only thing that stopped me from rating stars the point system I ve had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase and reached out to McDonald s customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn t happened 
1,This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo The staff is always friendly here the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonald s in the area Prices are typical of the food chain service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food Can t go wrong here especially with the kids They will love it 
1,Very nice fancy CLEAN restrooms that s a plus Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat jacket or purse Overall it s a well managed McDonald s compared to others I seen A rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme It s a tourist attraction Thank you McDonald s for your professionalism in management and customer service Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat jacket diaper bag and or purse thanks 
1,McDonald s is McDonald s Consistent menu food quality What sepates this location from other s is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking getting it out quickly and keeping area clean Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake a touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp Great place to go with kids 
1,I m guessing that this location is a training hub or something It seems like it s always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go Sheesh 
1,I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new
1,I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there Today we were there around pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for The only thing I didn t like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy I know why McDonald s do this but it s not the employees fault 
1,Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite More expensive than other McDonald s I visit I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo 
1,Very unique McDonald s They have all sorts of animal statues around that make random noises while you eat The play place is unique and the outside of the place has so many cool photo opportunities The food is typical McDonald s 
1,It s the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo This animal themed McDonald s has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner All in all it s different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo 
1,My yo granddaughter loved this place The play land is well designed with plenty of room for active exercise and the larger than life zoo animal motif delighted her 
1,No matter how many cars are in line they get you through pretty fast when I got to the window I wanted to get an extra order of fries and they told me they couldn t sell them to me 
1,I only eat breakfast here now but when I get my hot caramel its a hit or miss Sometimes its perfect days taste like dirty water but they will correct it 
1,I had to get out of the rain and service was really quick 
1,The ice cream is the best But the Hamburgs are to small and the frys the make are the best as long as there Hot
1,order was wrong but staff made it right and free burgers and fries
1,Son loved his happy meal this is the zoo McDonald s it is great it has fake animals and animal pictures everywhere
1,Would be slightly better if they paid more attention when you order Still pretty ok if you like the sounds of the zoo to follow you to lunch 
1,There is a new zoo animal added to the front can you guess what it is the service was gr and not a long wait 
1,Service is needing improvement car s backed uP in drive thru 
1,All order was correct and made quickly Ordered chicken sandwich Fries were burned Staff friendly busy stop 
1,The phone still taste good but the services gotten pretty slow I love all the inside playgrounds for the kids on these hot days
1,Always quick to get you served One of my favorites 
1,A Mickey D s outside of the zoo Brilliant And then to have it zoo themed perfect other than the shake sound scaring me while I ate 
1,Good coffee they didn t have the donut sticks I was craving for that s why I gave them stars
1,Keke is the best i appreciate her great service kindness n patience Young lady with a great future ahead Thanks KEKE
1,Very good pretty punctual there s some issue with the ordering ordering screen and the timing of all of that 
1,Noise of animals is scary There should be warnings aside from the cheetah print booth seat decal Beware 
1,Good place to eat at if you re on the go I like the sausage biscuit w egg and it s good 
1,Fresh food been around forever staff seems to have become better under new management A good bad location but over good place to eat 
1,Its what you would think Staff was friendly and quick service 
1,Very good customer service near the Dallas zoo very pretty theme of animals
1,The shrip and salmon tacos was absolutely tasted Great flavor
1,This McDonald s is very sometimy sometimes they get it perfect sometimes its horrible Best in the area though ill give them that 
1,Service was good food was normal play place was great except the AC wasn t working 
1,Yea I love your food so many varieties like dollar menu s 
1,Lines are long but thats to be expexted Frys were good and hot
1,It s line is usually long but that s normal Good spot if u want to grub on mc dz
1,FASTEST SERVICE OF THE McDONALS s LOCATION I DO NOT EAT HERE BT THE SERVICE FOR UBER EATZ WAS GREAT STAFF WAS NICE 
1,Love the zoo decorations with all the animals 
1,I have never seen a McDonald s painted this beautiful If you have not been you must visit 
1,My giant got to act up w The creatures Fun for all 
1,I had a large order they filled it quickly and politely 
1,Staff is very nice Food always hot 
1,Anytime I go I have an enjoyable experience so far If anything changes I ll post it 
1,Good quite place with good costumer service 
1,All I wanted was a steak egg and cheese bagel but they don t serve those at o clock in the morning but the food still good
1,Decent egg McMuffin and coffee The potato hash browns was just warm 
1,Good This time there was no wait for just a large chocolate 
1,My experience here was good came in ordered and got my food 
1,They have fake animals inside that make sounds when u tap them
1,Food could be warmer but it wasn t other than that it s near the Dallas zoo and is better than the other mcdonalds bear by 
1,Needs electrical outlets and wifi that works But excellent service friendly severance clean
1,This location has a very nice Zoo Theme kids love it 
1,Love to spend time here with my daughter We felt like kids again 
1,Not bad for a McDonald s Zoo animal themed Very busy for size 
1,The place was very clean nice and we got our food quick but our order was not complete and the guy got upset and mad when we asked for the rest of our order 
1,Great fresh food prep One of the best McDonald s I ve been to Unruly school kids ruined the experience
1,Went thru drive thru and food was served fast and correct 
1,Fairly clean majority of the time I guess that depends on who s working But the customer service is pretty fair in all my experiences here For a quick bite I prefer this specific McDonald s Food is always fresh And I never have to ask for napkins 
1,It s a very nice renewed place It s a shame that some homeless sleep inside the restaurant
1,Here you can order from a big touch screen and they bring the food to your table It s also possible to order in advance through the app and they bring you order to your car 
1,everybody screams on their own table It s not employees fault but environment terrible 
1,For a fast lunch on the go try a 
1,When your hungry it s the place to go 
1,Be sure to keep eye contact with who takes your order otherwise with the slew of Uber eats orders coming in by the second your order can easily become either relegated or dropped in priority Craving ice cream Ask them to make it last in your order for if you re waiting you might as well have ordered a milkshake being it will be pretty molten Overall the staff have changed for the better and their service continues to get better and better 
1,Solid dive bar with good food The chilli is excellent I had a salad which was decent too You can smoke inside which is a rarity these days Nice staff who are attentive and friendly in doing so It s in an odd location for sure 
1,Place is very clean The new way to order with the touch screen is very cool very modern The food is exactly what you would expect Very tasty The only downside was that you can only get napkins from one place near the kitchen so you have to get up to get them 
1,Good staff and good service
1,Overall a decent McDonald s Clean and fast 
1,This is what I call one of those places the food quality is always good it s the people inside specifically sometimes you have homeless sitting at a table or a very loud bunch of drunk adults kids I don t mind that s what they are suppose to do there is nothing they can do but I still get my order and eat at my scooter outside not fun but what can you do 
1,Great service
1,McDonald s is cool with me big breakfast is always really good McChicken sandwich and maybe a quarter pounder or two other than that yeah it s McDonald s
1,McDonald s is McDonald s This place is good for the Children the young peoples not for a old guy like me I just went there to buy a black coffee 
1,Well managed and the food is good Take it from an ex McDonald s employee
1,Always check your bag before leaving moderate defect rate
1,Quick service inside But drinks are behind the counter PARKING NOTE Make sure you park before you get to the drive thru there is no way back in from that point on 
1,Popular hr McDonald s w drive thru and indoor dining I visit for breakfast because theirs is one of the freshest 
1,Friendly staff clean and tasty food
1,Fast place for eating
1,Quick McDonalds Just need to check quality of food I received an old darker than usual and hard chicken in my sandwich 
1,I enjoy coming to eat to this McDonalds But the cashiers are very slow And many of them have bad attitudes
1,Today was not a bad experience friendly fresh food fairly clean Lobby I actually enjoyed myself here at McDonald s this morning
1,No surprises for my dinner a bacon double cheeseburger a McChicken and a iced tea The location isn t too bad for being downtown Miami
1,Very helpful and patient cashier and supervisor Walk in was very quick Drive thru was quite slow however 
1,It was ok at least the food was hot and fresh I visit other locations and this was by far the best 
1,Pretty good McDonald s if I m being honest Food was fast and good Staff was really nice 
1,Order online or use the kiosk do not wait in line
1,They only allowed me refill ony drink 
1,I don t like this food but I love ace cream 
1,Uts usually always busy and many times they get your order wrong but the coffee us great v
1,This is a VERY clean McDonalds
1,It was all right said quick service In and out 
1,Food fresh all the time fries hot Customer service needs to improve a little 
1,Fast and quick but don t forget to ask for napkins and ketchup They don t automatically put them in the bags 
1,Dollar men and other cheap food Could be your best place if you ar
1,Stopped in for a quick visit at this newly built location Nice bright dining room with fresh flowers on the tables The usual self ordering screens or a helpful staff behind the counter waiting to take your order If you are in need of 
1,I don t eat at McDonald s but I do UberEats deliveries I love this McDonald s because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesn t have one This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there 
1,It is just minutes away from the pier many homeless people inside and you should take good care of your belongings It is clean but employees barely smile and cold due to holiday working hours I guess Had the double burger cheese and oats meal which I do not complain It is thanks giving holiday 
1,The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonald s out there The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio They had the munchies I guess 
1,It s McDonald s 
1,Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance Food is prepped fast and staff are professional Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens I always take out from here and go to the beach Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there 
1,It s McDonald s by the pier McDonald s In the wee hours only time I go it can be colorful with the occasional altercation conflict but they have security Never had a issue there Order my food from the kiosk wait p u eat while I walk home and later wish that I didn t order to sandwiches 
1,It s a McD s fast food cause you don t have a lot of time when you re going somewhere Convenient place to grad a quick breakfast in the morning with all other shops still closed
1,It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at McDonald s Since Covid the option to dine in was removed Remarkable 
1,It s not clean and there are no offers but still ok Bathroom is usually clean
1,Lots of homeless people inside
1,To be honest I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky D s for its coffee I have to wake up pretty early so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at am With that being said I will also say that because of Santa Monica s influx of homelessness over the years this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons Most are nice and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time however it s the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome The staff tries to placate situations but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday So if you can t handle talk be patient and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day the don t go here I don t need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing Bye 
1,This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier about block away I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends Do note that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily this McDonalds in particular gets very packed So please be kind to them they are trying their best to get your food served 
1,It s a Nice McDonald s due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the pier also people talk about beggers being near it but I didn t see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs
1,The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of is because overall I don t eat McDonald s or fast food However the one day that I did go to Santa Monica I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean The staff there were also very hospitable friendly and alert I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside I haven t had McDonald s since so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it Everything was okay okay with me 
1,Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and outside Remove that you get stars Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the restaurant Food is your typical McDonald s no change there They offer a bathroom but its a busy location Overall I d return with caution 
1,There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff but it seems that the issue has improved My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons They always get our order right and the delivery is seamless 
1,Very nice very clean Saw a guy come in who looked homeless and security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out It was kind of impressive yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasn t all there Also the men s rest room was very clean however I d prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser I like to use paper towels to touch these things especially the door when leaving 
1,Fine it s always busy place
1,Good McD centrally located and quick service 
1,Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces homeless and everything that goes with that the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean service helpful and food good as always We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids no this extra that and each burger was put together exactly as ordered 
1,No different than any other McDonalds except that it s in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach It s surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast Seating can be an issue on very crowded days Over all good experience and not too bad 
1,They always have a lot of staff in hand specially on the week ends and at peak hours You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier This also means that there will be homeless there as well I like to live and let live so I don t mind sharing space with my fellow man With that said there is security at hand at all times Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonald s with a smile You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location 
1,They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled and they also gave us the actual orders we bought All in all they were pretty fast workers They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier I understand that it s not always going to be clean there because frankly there s not much room to clean there most of the time If I could give stars I would 
1,We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner The food was always made correct and fresh however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult No condiments are self serve the security guard has to let you into the bathroom sometimes hard to find a table 
1,I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals the burgers were cold and tasted funny they ate the fries and of course really liked the toy inside out of today mediocre 
1,It was crowded Unfortunately they don t do refills here 
1,The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite you can eat on the patio but not for long 
1,It s McDonald s cheap sustenance to keep on going We had a couple burgers and fries and I can t complain they were alright when the price is taken into account It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times The restaurant itself was pretty clean what you come to expect from a McDonald s 
1,We only eat halal food The fillet o fish is a good choice for us but the price is high Though it 
1,It s a McDonald s it didn t disappoint I got another one supersize And that s what I wanted Fade Out on the floor back back back to get a bag over there balcony Exactly what I wanted no surprises 
1, midnight this place is packed and they bring it to your table 
1,They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked for here or to go The service was fast I had my food ready before I could fill up my drink 
1,Eco friendly flatware restroom is locked up tight transients Employees are dismissive and arrogant Not courteous and refuses to answer questions about food products ie what s on a cheeseburger answer would be Cheese bread But the food is hot and fast 
1,The food was fast and good for McDonald s The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building The entrance smelled like urine 
1,They literally almost got the entire order wrong would not come back ever My family got two deluxe s round egg small decaf coffee med coffees with sugar and cream We ended up with packets of ketchup no bread for the muffins in the deluxes no hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time Also there is another McDonald s in my area that s pretty lame This place has a better service overall sort of long review sorry 
1,The restaurant was clean and orderly Food was prepared fast and made properly Everything was decent 
1,The recently advertised real meat patties for their Quarter Pounder burger more or less was what you expect same great taste same great value though it did not fail it however didn t feel any different from their other burger options on their selected menu Would I get it again Yeah why not Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second third and maybe fourth Who knows really Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks 
1,Its mc donalds what can i say
1,The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in Due to its proximity to the Pier there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store 
1,Lines can be long but service is friendly Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait The employees do practice good customer service 
1,It s an interesting location for a McDonald s and this property must be super expensive Aside from that it s a good enough place and I give it stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonald s to begin with If you re on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets this is your spot 
1,They get you in and out fast I love this McDonald s adjacent to the beach and the Metro Expo Line
1,The order was done really quickly and that was greatly appreciated because we were in a hurry We bought McNuggets and they tasted amazing Every one 
1,The food was good I mean they put several pickles in my yummy burger The fries were perfect The wait was a little long 
1,Chain Criteria Clean Interior and or Restrooms Fast Service 
1,I love the CA McDonalds have McChickens we only have Hot N Spicy in AZ The service was fast and the food was fresh and cheap It was also accurate no missing items This is how fast food should always be 
1,Good as every other mcdonalds but only one big difference A lot like a looot of homeless people here I like it because of the staff but too many homeless that and this time the resroom run out of seat covers lol
1,Ruthlessly expensive McDonalds food because it s by the beach but they take the mobile order deals Security on site though not too pushy People seemed friendly enough 
1,The cheapest place to eat at when your by the pier literally If your on a budget Mikey Ds serves you at its finest The problem is they dont have the dollar menu anymore and this place can get packed during lunch hours 
1,I go to every McDonalds I can This one is quick service and good food But please note that it gets a little crazy at night time This is a very busy spot next to the pier 
1,Always a nice and friendly place to go Fast and with good prices as always It will be there when you need a food 
1,Was a McDonald s You know what you get The store itself was clean the service was prompt and the people were nice The automated ordering machines were a pain to use though and we gave up as it was unresponsive
1,Kind of confusing as people were just standing everywhere and one of the workers looked lost herself Once it cleared out some t hmm ings settled the food was accurate and warm 
1,This is my go to McDonald s now with automated cashiers ordering is quick and easy nice and clean courteous employees it s just getting better 
1,No bad location easy to find service is kinda slow at times though 
1,The food was great Service was quick They forgot napkins and ketchup for my to go order 
1,The staffs were very friendly and our food was good The facility was clean They were very busy and our food was was good However our food was not delivered until about minutes after we placed our order We wanted to try McDonald s pasta I 
1,This McDonald s is one of the nicest and coolest McDonald s I ve ever been to It is a two story McDonald s with a play place and an arcade They offer non traditional menu options such as build your own pasta ravioli pizza cake cheese cake etc it truly is a one of a kind McDonald 
1,World largest McDonald s Food is the same they have pizza and pasta too The seating and ordering process was quick and easy but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge Our burgers came in fairly fast minutes or so but pizza took minutes from the time when we ordered it I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza Honestly this worth a single visit especially the playground if you have kids If you looking for a quick bite I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service 
1,This place is huge Large play place and fun arcade Pizza at McDonalds Yup we tried it Overall it was delicious and had great flavor although the crust was a little thin for my liking Overall fairly clean floors were a little sticky Bathrooms were clean 
1,This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table Only stars though because the food was cold when it arrived Probably would have given it stars but I got extra nuggets in my happy meal 
1,World s biggest McDonald s They serve Pizza and Pasta here I tried them both To be honest I didn t know what to expect from the pasta but I guess i
1,Very cool place got food on menu you will not see at any other McDonald s The pasta was cool but not the best Service was really good Had a good time 
1,Overall a good experience at this McDonald s the largest in Florida if not the country a very big place I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade area just ate and ran But additional options here pizza and pasta I had both and both equally good A little longer wait for those items so expect the additional cook
1,Well I guess I checked something off my bucket list I didn t even know I had The WORLD S biggest McDonald s How cool Pasta on dishware at McDonald s Yes please The place was a madhouse but worth it for the experience It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didn t let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area I know kinda mean But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous Definitely worth the visit even for just a cheeseburger And KUDOS to all employees this place is NUTS AND a drive thru Bless y all 
1,This was a great experience I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to The pizza was really good Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy but other then that I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando
1,The food was quality but service took a while I liked the food a lot I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both I also got a large fries a burger and drinks Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places Only con I d recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it s like this 
1,Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest McDonalds I mean it s just a fast food place right Wrong The place is huge brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations the everyday McDonald s kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade playhouse and more sit down area The pizza was only after toppings It was a small personal pie thin and crispy b
1,Great place for the kids playground and playroom are great I recommend you the min for just play card while waiting for your food it can take longer that other McDonald very busy place

1,I stated at a near by hotel This was the only thing around open late Only the drive thru was open The drive thru took min When it was my turn to order the cashier skip my lane and helped car from the other lane first 
1,There s nothing special about a big Mac I m not sure about this location but I ve definitely paid for a big mac meal Better at better prices elsewhere 
1,The fries were hot but barely had salt on it I couldn t taste any flavor
1,The girl taking our order was so incredibly nice She was helpful and cheerful and really got our day off to a great start The food was great and and it was done quickly 
1,In contrast to the many radical reviews this location was slick modern new clean Small downstairs because the kitchen is upstairs At p m there were about to times more cars lined up to get to the drive thru than there were people inside My food was fine nothing too positive or negative This IS a McDonald s not your family BBQ 
1,It s a newly renovated McDonald s has a very skinny drive thru so be cautious It s advertised as hours but isn t always open Have gotten food here several times since reopening Every time food has been hot and tasted fresh Customer service was surprisingly good Will up date in the future Trying to eat healthier you should as well Fa t food hould never be a daily thing Warning 
1,Had to order at the kiosk Good was fast and freshly made great for a quick meal on the go The interior of the place was very sterile No menus above the counter This location was just remodeled too not liking it at all 
1,A bit of a long line in the drive thru but the workers where moving the lines along They friendly at the windows 
1,Hot fries and standard fare Can get very very busy in weekend nights at the drive through 
1,I want to return to this McDonald s some day when the pandemic ends The lobby looks cozy to dine in 
1, hrs Isn t that enough Hot coffee Comfort food 
1,It was clean It was not too crowded The items I ordered were up fast It s a place to go when you don t have a lot of dough and not a lot of time I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just need something fast 
1,Decent McDonald s newly rebuilt quick drive through Sometimes food s been under heatlamp a bit long though 
1,Little bit of a wait but that s pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces The location didn t look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street It s McDonald s not a chic fil a you get what you pay for
1,A little small for my taste It is one of the older McDonalds so it doesn t have outlets The staff is great though There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice and it seems like he never has a bad day None of the staff as far as I have seen discriminate against homeless people Their humanity gets them the extra star 
1,Beware of the parking it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded if you are backing up you may have to wait or even worse get hit by a car backing up I actually saw this Not a big fan of McDonalds food but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar Service is always great 
1,This place has clean restroom The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park The dining area is not so big but clean The cashier was friendly and welcoming I like that breakfast was served all day 
1,It s McDonald s but not too bad considering they just completely remodeled the place The kitchen is now upstairs and it has smaller foot print with a bigger more organized parking area 
1,As far as McDonalds go this is a pretty good one Know how I can tell Fries are always blistering hot I live near this McDonald s and I don t have to force myself to come here even though I pick up food or times per month Stuff that s supposed to be hot is hot stuff that is supposed to be cold is cold As far as the service goes here s the amazing thing mostly millennials are working here and the service is still good If you are in the area and hungry I recommend this McDonald s but please don t tease the Millinials they get spooked easy and stampede Thanks 
1,It s a little bit hard to get in and out of the parking lot other than that everybody is very nice and it s a good facility they don t run as many specials or deals like by two or buy one get one free on the breakfast sandwiches and stuff like a lot of other McDonald s do so that s why I didn t give him five stars other than that the place is clean and they re good
1,McDonald s is awesome get the app with that you can get cent large iced coffee 
1,Small but very busy McDonald s location with a drive thru They offer their standard menu and service is reasonably fast They do have extra attendants working the drive thru during busy hours to try and move traffic along 
1,The new design is futuristic Self order no register sleek design compact Impressive 
1,It s McDonalds If you don t know to check your bags before you pull away then you ve never been to a fast food restaurant before The service was friendly and the new menu items are fun to try Seriously though it doesn t deserve one Star reviewing I ve been to some true one Star places and this isn t one of them 
1,This place has a small parking lot but the inside is generally clean and cool The soda machines Diet Dr Pepper tastes a little off other than that the service is good and the food is well put together 
1,They know how you make early morning coffee taste yummy to the last drop 
1,I used to work across the street so I would go there quite often Usually quick On occasion I would wait minutes to get my order Otherwise good service 
1,It was very busy for the time I came in I had a minute wait on my food
1,I guess for a McDonald s it deserves stars because it was perfectly a normal McDonald s but it is still the lowest common denominator when looking for food so Don t expect more than McDonald s but it was clean and the food was hot 
1,It was McDonald s The service was fast and friendly The food was good and most importantly the FRENCH FRIES were HOT NOTHING WORST THAN COLD FRENCH FRIES 
1,This is my go to McDonald s and it 
1,Always buy my ice coffee here usually it s perfect but a few times it taste really watery or over loaded on cream milk or even vanilla flavor
1,The standard McDonald s menu the staff is friendly the restaurant is clean They do get busy and sometimes they get a little behind but not a lot 
1,The new rebuilt mcdonalds looks nice also drive thru lanes now 
1,It s not a great place but it s not too bad of a McDonald s to just go in have a quick meal to eat there or take it with u
1,Nice customer service free Wi Fi and they even have outside seats small parking lot though Overall good experience 
1,Place is too small Once you order I waited for my food and I really didn t have anyplace to stand without getting in someone s way 
1,Drive through is faster than walk in Food is good for McD s 
1,Very friendly fast counter personal always willing to make sure your order is correct
1,The Place was okay excepting the bathroom i know it s difficult have that clean and beauty but could be better conditions
1,McDonald s in North Hollywood very good customer service you got to deal with the homeless a lot right there though a good McDonald s to go to
1,Fast and efficient 
1,always cheerful and always helpful great service the only downside is OVER RUN BY HOMELESS PEOPLE all the time 
1,Would have got five stars but they were out of ice cream cones Boo 
1,Its McDonalds Drive through is narrow and has a sharp turn but other than that one thing it s your standard McD s 
1,It s ok if you want something fast the people are friendly 
1,This is a busy McDonald s so there is generally a wait at the drive thru and parking lot is tight

1,This location has a fun indoor playroom area The play equipment always seems to be clean and well maintained I take my two year old granddaughter there occasionally and she always has fun The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screen interactive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it Every time we re there she stomps on it to try to make it work She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work I
1,We love coming here Tried the Shamrock Mcflurry and it was delicious 
1,Their employees needs to learn customer service 
1,It s a pretty nice McDonald s Not highest quality of food of course cuz it s fast food but I like the fries and getting deals I ve tried the mobile order a few times too and it s cool how they bring it to you and feels like there s less wait 
1,Very clean lobby and facility Coffee was fresh Service was quick 
1,Classic fast food with addictive french fries Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US Consistency and quality are worth each visit 
1,Always enjoy this McDonald s and I am not a fan of the food The food is hot and correct majority of the time The play area is great and staff is friendly Keep up the good work 
1,Always fast their food always tastes much more delicious than other mcdonalds 
1,Clean play area for children minimal staff but working hard I asked for veggie sandwhich because I am a vegitarian i said lettuce tomatoes cheese onion stuff like that but my sandwhich came out with pickles and cheese they took it back put a tomatoe and peace of lettuce on it I wish McDonalds had a nice big veggie sandwich to fill me up 
1,First time in a long time that I have been to McDonald s and the staff actually treated me like they appreciated my being a customer I took off star because they were stingy with the mayo on my hamburger 
1,They have big macs but no all day breakfast mobile app works well though make sure you activate the order when u arrive I M HERE or no one will know what you re talking about
1,Awesome vanilla cones 
1,Ate inside food was fine and order was correct Overall was a good visit Just wish was a little cleaner of a restaurant 
1,I think this place is under new management I had a quarter pounder and it was really good and made right Friendly service and very clean 
1,Unfortunately they got my order wrong but I still gave stars bevause the employees are always so nice and friendly 
1,Clean and good service The only problem is the drive through window always open because the busy order during morning flies get in easily 
1,Came here for McDonald s was not disappointed Loved the arches some lady hit the curb behind me kinda funny Food and service were great 
1,It s a McDonald s standard to a fault Has a pretty clean interior but not a lot of booth seating The food is what you would expect from McDonald s
1,good for when ya need it that new spicy chicken sandy 
1,They get the order right the good is always hot The kids enjoy the play place and the whole place is clean 
1,Took my nephew to play eat First one ive been to with a working interactive floor projection game Suited my needs
1,Not a big fan of McDonald s but I do love their fries and cheeseburgers 
1,This is a McDonald s so the food is normal and good I liked the service here and would come again
1,The time I was there very busy I ordered the a new cheese cake so I had to wait I didn t have to wait to long A associate brought it to the car 
1,Only giving the th star for a good attitude at the window Its a McDs so you know the drill supposed fast service friendly smile and hood food Doesn t happen theses days but I am yet to have a server here that is rude unconcerned or uninterested in their job They get it done efficiently and respectfully 
1,Hey McDonalds please go back having the dollar Apple pies I miss those apple pies that you can reheat in the microwave and eat with vanilla ice cream Please consider At this location the driveway was long but fast It was just the drivers was taking their time moving up My order was right the workers was respectful Yes I will go again The food was hot 
1,Fast Convenient and friendly my orders are always correct and speedy drive thru service Good friendly cashiers and managers They even have an ordeing kiosk 
1,My experience here at the McDonald s in Newark is ok the place is decent the restaurant is really clean and the vibe is new and updated I got the new shamrock shake McFlurry with Oreos it was very sweet but it was still very good the employees is ok but my on
1,I ve been here many times and they ve never messed up my order which is a better track record than most McDs I ve frequented Above average for a McDs but they should work on keeping the fries fresher often old stale and gross Few things better than fresh McD fries and few things worse than old ones 
1,I went to a different McDonald s the one in New Jersey where my boyfriend lives it s good I would go all the way back over there for that juicy burger I had so mouth watery 
1,This place is ok 
1,Not bad but they don t let people use the bathroom even if buying
1,Just for a coffe have to wait longer than usually but I love the coffe 
1,Breakfast specials are good The sausage burrito and sausage McMuffins with eggs are freshly cooked Been wanting to try their spam eggs and rice but during our visit their rice cooker isn t working so t
1,Limited menu here especially the breakfast items Food came out pretty fast though and was good 
1,It s McDonald s You know what you re gonna get Lobby was closed at the hour we went but there were seating options out by the beach so that was fine Its nice to have somewhere cheap and quick to eat late at night because everything else that was open was sit down and much pricier 
1,Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Ave Long line in the morning for breakfast Staff friendly and they can will deliver to your table which is the only reason I gave it stars Complaints homeless person racked out at one of the 
1,This is a pretty automated McDonald s Probably one of the most automated ones I ve come across Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though Plus the area to stand was congested since it 
1,There are two lanes of drive through I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line When I got to the speaker they didn t bother to ask my order or order number They just kept taking people from the other line I know that sometimes happens they forget the order cars pull up But not in a row As they started taking the th car I pulled into the line and went to the window Food was OK when I got it But waiting minutes for that to happen in the drive through isn t cool 
1,Update Megan is still here and amazing as ever She joyfully asked if she could get us refills YES They offer refills again Yay You just have to ask in case she s not there Fashima and two other gentlemen working were also very friendly and even offered to help carry my food to the table Almost like we were at a real sit down restaurant the way they took care of us Thank you The only thing was that the quarter pounder seemed small and was overcooked and dry But we will be back Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering If give her stars we don t do refills here What So the funny thing is they are moving to have you order at the kiosk but you need to ask for the refills which they don t do because the beverage machine is shut down Just so you know when you go 
1,Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions Be prepared to wait mins in the drive thru even for a mobile order
1,Clean place with prompt and accurate service The chicken nuggets were delicious and crunchy We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait time The attendant confirmed our order no less than twice and I was given exactly what we asked The inside is clean as well as the bathrooms and has a lot of seating There s also an indoor play area for the kiddos In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers 
1,Very polite service Very clean One has the ability to self order Playhouse for the little ones Thank you Ileanna for the great coroner service Keep up the great work 
1,For a McDonalds I was pleased Ordered at a kiosk but they brought us our food to the table Order was correct and food arrived quickly Quite clean 
1,Same service like every McDonald 
1,It s McDonald s You know what you re getting You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in they re going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry There s no reason to give these service workers a hard time they re doing what they can Thanks guys Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it s always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes 
1,As a McDonald s goes it was great Fries where hot burger fresh and the pies where hot My only complaint is that the opinions where very limited 
1,Just a standard maccies I would prefer during the drive thru thst the menu 
1,Easy and fast drive through experience is always a plus
1,Great experience getting a late snack here tonight
1,This McDonald s usually ROCKS They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under min Tonight there was no line Also the inside was closed AND THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN SHUT OFF SHOCKER My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat So thats why we went Then they didn t put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot So I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag She said No we can t do that REALLY I have worked in the food industry for years I am well aware of what you can and can not do You didn t WANT TO You didn t want to value me as a person a customer or a future You didn t want to do your job properly in the st place You didn t want to apologize in any way shape or form I don t mind that a mistake was made I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with There are other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius 
1,The line was super long but I guess that s what should be expected when you get off the airplane at night and it s the only place still open Thank you McDonald s Despite the line the food was super good The crispy chicken sandwich was shared hours later slightly heated in the microwave and still great The McNuggets were even good Days later according to my daughter 
1,This location just recently allows you to dine in But there are like thirds of the seating unavailable The selfservice screen were not accepting card payments so you need to complete transactions at cashier anyways defeating the purpose of contactess ordering 
1,The service is good and food is fresh the only bad thing is just that its always packed because is a tourist area 
1,Best icecream ever vanila cone
1,This location has kiosk to place your orders only similar to New York then you wait for your number to be called to get your food Staff was very busy place was clean Not super friendly 
1,The drive thru lane was fast When I got the meal it was fresh and taste it good But the only thing the orange juice was warm and the coffee they put their milk and sugar but it was no sweet enough Also they forgot to give us ketchup 
1,I eat here once in a while when I m in a rush or just need a good fish sandwich Always good and fresh never any issues with the drive though which times out of is what I use Good place for fast food Drive through attendants are always quick and polite 
1,Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually broken I m pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we couldn t order any ice cream related products All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if I m ever in the area again 
1,Excellent and fresh hot food The inside is spacious and clean Friendly staff but I don t like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad makes it hard to customize your order and confusing I d rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonald s But at this McDonald s you must order at the touch pad by yourself 
1,Friendly staff always busy but food done in a good time and always hot Restaurant kept very clean Plenty of parking A good McDonalds to be fair 
1,We came here twice during our visit to the area The first day I would have given them stars the service was fantastic and despite being extremely busy they gave great attention to each guest The second time however we came through the drive through and the service was terrible It was very early in the morning there were only a few other cars in line maybe in front of us and we were in line for at least minutes 
1,Employee was rude but it fine 
1,Kind of touch and go with this location Sometimes they re very attentive and sometimes they don t listen when you re trying to give them your order Late night is when I ve generally had problems with their service Otherwise they are pretty good 
1,Always a favorite McD s is still serving up all the favorites we were there for breakfast and had a short wait Alas no dining room availability at this location for now Very reasonable prices of course and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries 
1,Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins a large french vanilla coffee My wait time was approximately minutes I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed Again usually this restaurant is a five star McDonald s just not on this day 
1,Just stopped by my local McDonald s to pick up some breakfast items before going to work The th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food I can t believe how much I ve been eating at McDonald s the last years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the s Food is definitely better than it used to be and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts 
1,The food is always on the meh side Luke warm never hot and fresh even when it s busy and the employees are typically miserable 
1,New interior looks great This location has the new digital ordering computers The food came quickly and the staff were helpful Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasn t marked
1,Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults The food is your typical McDonald s fare with nothing special to write about They have a large parking lot and the bathrooms were clean during my visit My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays 
1,It can get tight getting inside when there s a delivery truck next to the store Most especially when you re going towards the drive thru 
1,This is one of the busiest McDonald s I have ever seen Very modern inside Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food At least it was very fresh 
1,Great workers were very helpful Eating area play area were clean Men s bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall Overall will come again 
1,Very clean and it taste as usual
1,I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased Even though I am trying to eat healthier these days I just can t stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly with a delicious sandwich 
1,The ice cream machine was actually working at this store Drive thru speaker was hard to hear No wait and quick service 
1,Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers
1,It s a good place for fast food
1,The line for drive thru was out to the street Not their fault it is not the first time Once I got to pay point it was quick 
1,Food was good don t like self order screens
1,The place was clean the washroom stalls needs repairs and it was clean but smells like urine big time Staff are friendly and helpful Thanks Rick Stasiuk Wetaskiwin Alberta Canada T A R 
1,This particular McDonalds across from Old Town is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my chicken sandwich meal Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything The strips needed more cook time my opinion so I brought them inside and made the request Now it s McDonald s you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it told the M O D and he says he can take care of it he just needed about mins I told him no problem and waited Now when I did receive it he made sure he gave it to me and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip of stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didn t like 
1,We were visiting Orlando and I needed coffee Service was fast Staffs were friendly The sausage biscuit taste like freezer The coffee was good 
1,Read down place has changed a lot Getting to be excellent place to go Not good new construction is nice But understaffed Even at am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage Also the floors heavily littered Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant but alot of foreign domestic vacationers are just filthy They just drop food and wrappers everywhere When they are done eating they just get up and leave Host busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs More register coverage for the guests When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient I have had errors in my visits First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday s yes of them I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left The nd error wasn t caught till we where eating the Sunday s at home I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both Yeah it was only and some change but it was the principal I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home I always request plastic bag s for my food because the one paper bag they put my burgers fails halfway home The nd one is for the Sunday s Another epic failure ordered mcdouble no mustard and onions bacon mcdouble and mcdouble regular Received the mcdouble wo mustard and onions no problem bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail large fries ordered and received medium sized fries and of the smallest sized fries I ve ever seen guess they where kids sized fail The peice fry came without incident Less than of the whole order came correctly Getting better and better the manager Monique she runs a tight ship Every time I m in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing A great thank you for your great service Monique Wow place was packed Was able to wait just a short time and got my order Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff Must of been people in line only min wait Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks both with smile s on 
1,The line was long but they moved us right along all employees were friendly and courteous the food was fresh and hot I will definitely go back to this McDonald s again

1,Went through the drive through nothing to complain about But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there Too many fast food places in this area are like that though Maybe if they got paid a livable wage they d be happier Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too Yeah I think so

1,Haven t seen a nice McDonald 
1,Nice place for kids to grab quick fries Close to Hilton Orlando Just a walking distance if you need something Next to them there 
1,Ordered thru the app which was a quick and easy process Mcflurry and shakes were broken and unavailable at the time of visit Parked in curbside pickup as drive through line was long Quickly and accurately received my order 
1,This McDonald 
1,Tried ordering at the drive thru but the manager that was helping the drive thru operator apparently is unaware of the current bogo promotion told me I had to order to get the promotion so had to go inside and order thru the totens to be able to place my order including the promotion Besides that all clean food was good and service inside was outstanding 
1,Most interesting McDonald s that I ve ever been It features a fish tank an arcade and serves pizza and pastas Great place to visit as it is very unusual and interesting However do avoid going there past pm as it go
1,The food was served fast but the time in the drive thru was very long It is clean and friendly staff 
1,Cool place to visit Workers were very rude and got multiple orders wrong while we were there 
1,When you re hungry almost anything tastes good Thankfully their food was fully cooked unlike other locations 
1,Dream this place was amazing I mean the food was expensive but really good and the arcade had amazing games but unfortunately the prize room was closed cuz of COVID but this was a good experience
1,Nice stop after Disney World I did like it better before they remodeled 
1,It was very loud and crowded with kids goofing off and yelling Totally bad Can t even eat inside around the after school time 
1,Little more expensive than your average McDonalds but I suppose that is to be expected due to the location One nice benefit is that they do accept the coupons in the McDonald s app 
1,Fairy fast service considering how busy this location was Could have been a little cleaner Food was good but unfortunately certain items that are only available their menu were not available when we went Large inside playground and has a arcade 
1,Food hot and good Excellent service 
1,Usually ate breakfast here while in town for a conference Be prepared to order from a screen But the good news is that there are plenty of screens 
1,We stopped on the way home for a late night snack and drinks for our ride home Food as expected friendly service outside looked clean 
1,The place immaculate place your order at the kiosk pick up a number and it was brought to your table The attendant was very helpful and friendly 
1,Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or tartar sauce due to a dairy allergy When I got to the pick up window they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected Unfortunately this happens constantly no matter what McDonald s I go too It s clear the prep team simply isn t paying attention to the instructions on the orders 
1,My family and i had come to Orlando for the weekend only so since Sunday morning we were ti head back to Miami We wanted ti get ahead of the traffic so we decided that we would order breakfast and eat as we traveled and McDonald s was our spot The lines were long but it moved pretty fast and we were happy I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great 
1,Tgey forgot us at the curbside pickup mins
1,Friendly staff Clean restaurant
1,I personally haven t had any issues with this location In the years I ve lived close by there have been times where the drive through was majorly backed up and something was clearly wrong But of maybe trips in the last few years I ve had good service and fresh food 
1,Good hot food A bit of a wait for a McMuffin at am Nobody else in line at the drive thru They had to ask the chicken for more eggs 
1,We stopped at McDonald s just for drinks It seems they were low on ice and 
1,Busy busy busy Prepare for a wait Location is good Restaurant is clean Employees are nice Orders are accurate Ordering Keosks are cool Well laid out up to date but prepare to wait This place is busy beyond repair Drive through stacked at least cars waiting with both wait stalls full For the last hour people lined up inside with of the kiosks in use Prepare for minimum minutes inside 
1,Food was decent Cashier had difficulties with card in drive thru saying machine was asking for pin Odd Large order but smoothies three quarters of way filled Filled but looked like ice and concentrate added They did remake it which turned out fine 
1,No wait in drive thru line They got the order right Fries were nice and hot and the staff was respectful I did not five stars because the girl at the drive thru struggled to understand me english was not her native language She tried though and it all worked out I got my correct order and in a timely manner 
1,I don t normally review McDonald s but this is a good one because of the staff right now You know what the food is like so no need to discuss you either like it or you don t There is a very sweet older lady that works here that is phenominal She likes her job is nice to customers and actually makes this place great I will be back Thi
1,Very busy usually fresh hot food fried typically don t have salt on them have been multiple times before with the same issue Prices also higher than other mcdonalds otherwise clean friendly employees fresh food
1,No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long Would recommend over McDonald s entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher 
1,Middle of the day and they were fast efficient and friendly the fries were hot everything was fresh
1,Only used thr drive through but order was correct and the food was good Busy unit given its location but the flow through the two lanes was pretty swift Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant 
1,The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met Tasha was the sweetest worker there The food was good and as isially good price They had some fancy new machines that had to be machines I was lost and couldn t get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy But overall good time okay food good people
1,Totally not the staff s fault but there was only person to take orders from the double drive thru There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected it 
1,Busy but the line went pretty fast but had a mix up on the order 
1,When i walked in i saw a nice line and thought oh no but they brought there A game that day they got everyone in and out My order was correct and my ff were hot The restaurant was clean and i got great service 
1,Very busy here at night maybe a good mins to get u food
1,I loved your pepperoni pizza and California suhshi Highly recommend this clinic 
1,We stopped for an annual anniversary shamrock shake and they didn t have shamrock shakes On St Patrick 
1,I don t like self order machines
1,Long lines here since it s in a tourist area but the service was friendly and the food was hot Just be prepared to wait in line for a while 
1,It was a little pricey Just like eating in a real restaurant for a family of But I m sure it cheaper if you get normal meau things We got noodles and pizza It was plenty of food for the price 
1,Probably the nicest McDonald s I ve been too Staff was super nice and really trying their best to make happy customer s and smiles We even got to try free blueberry pies The pies were AWESOME 
1,Nice staff quick service
1,New kiosk based ordering can be a little daunting at first But it does seem to speed things up The food is what you ve come to expect from McDonald s It didn t disappoint 
1,Late last minute am food run McDonald s is pretty much the way to go lol 
1,Had to order on the tablet screen Then I was told to take a number to my table and it would be brought out They never brought it out and I had to go ask for it at the counter minutes later 
1,Biggest McDonald s in America with an extended menu arcade and play area It is a Must go just not now lol play area is currently closed due to COVID and arcade area needs a little tlc a little wipe down on dust
1,Crowded long waiting list 
1,the food was good but the pineapple smoothie did not taste like pineapple smoothie taste like ice only 
1,Very good we had icecreem it was good sitting area 
1,Busy but orders are right Needs someone on the floor constantly to clean dining area customers are slobs here leaving trash everywhere Tourist clean your shuff this is someone elses home 
1,Great overall but carefull with togo orders
1,Clean convenient and efficient only issue is that the member of staff that served me was very grumpy and really not very friendly at all It was as if she was in a foul mood 
1,Same food but really good service 
1,This McDonalds is newly renovated with self ordering kiosk This McDonalds also brings to food to you table for all dining guest thats someting you normally dont see at anyother McDonalds The only issue was seating the new furniture at this restaurant is not kid friendly the table is way shorter than other Mcdonalds my daughter was spilling food all over the floor 
1,It s McDonalds The food is consistent McDonalds ordering is through the sel serve kiosks or drive through

1,Really enjoyed my breakfast this morning Hot and fresh Not a long line at all They were getting the orders in and out I really appreciated the young lady at the counter She made me a
1,Very very very slow service shame on this store it took minutes to cook a quarter pounder when on the paper only takes about minutes if you use the press minutes I worked in Boulder city Nevada as an assistant Mgr And we had minutes to get one order out and minute special orders so I don t get it but On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise don t even try it because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT 
1,The food would have been great if the tables weren t so nasty
1,I only buy things from the menu sausage muffin bundle and a sweet tea half sweet half unsweetened They consistently make the best tea out of the McDonald I frequent 
1,Its McDonalds The place is remodelled Gone are the Zoo themed life sized animal replicas on thee inside 
1,It s a macdonals so food is alright It was clean and loved the jungle decor thats a nice touch Only thing was the baby changing station the table opened outwards instead of longways like a regular one and it was leaning toward And with my o month old it was just a slide 
1,The Lady was a little rude over the speaker but face to face she was nice so I gave her a compliment regarding her hair But my order was right everything was not except the cinnamon roll that s why I only gave them stars please warm up the cinnamon rolls
1,Order was correct but drive thru took long
1,Great people fast not mess up your order real pros to The manager asked if my order was right He s was great nice polite and friendly 
1,Food is always fresh and hot 
1,The best looking McDonald s I have ever visited Located near the zoo Friendly staff and fast service 
1,Was good service would ve been better if we wasn t walking around a homeless person passed out on the sidewalk was strange for sure
1,Love the French fries The coffee drinks are great Excellent place for small children They do have healthy good for the kiddos Fun place to play Many treasured memories with my little grandson He s now 
1,It would be nice if the play place was open again but it s not so that was disappointing It s clean employees are nice got my order right 
1,This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites I like this location because the people are always nice and the service is always fast This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time 
1,I ve been going there for many years as they are close to where I live They are consistently decent They usually get it right it s normally fairly fresh it is McDonald s so They do make a darned good cup of coffee which is what brings me back usually I generally think of coffee when I think of Mickey D s 
1,This was a good McD They made a good product that wasn t smashed in a bag and thrown out the window They actually salted the fries that s a lost art anymore And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles Obviously a happy crew does better work 
1,I ve used the drive through only Service is great I love the outd
1,I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind friendly the night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer service but the only thing that stopped me from rating stars the point system I ve had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase and reached out to McDonald s customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasn t happened 
1,This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo The staff is always friendly here the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonald s in the area Prices are typical of the food chain service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food Can t go wrong here especially with the kids They will love it 
1,Very nice fancy CLEAN restrooms that s a plus Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat jacket or purse Overall it s a well managed McDonald s compared to others I seen A rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme It s a tourist attraction Thank you McDonald s for your professionalism in management and customer service Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat jacket diaper bag and or purse thanks 
1,McDonald s is McDonald s Consistent menu food quality What sepates this location from other s is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking getting it out quickly and keeping area clean Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake a touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp Great place to go with kids 
1,I m guessing that this location is a training hub or something It seems like it s always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go Sheesh 
1,I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new
1,I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there Today we were there around pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for The only thing I didn t like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy I know why McDonald s do this but it s not the employees fault 
1,Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite More expensive than other McDonald s I visit I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo 
1,Very unique McDonald s They have all sorts of animal statues around that make random noises while you eat The play place is unique and the outside of the place has so many cool photo opportunities The food is typical McDonald s 
1,It s the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo This animal themed McDonald s has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner All in all it s different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo 
1,My yo granddaughter loved this place The play land is well designed with plenty of room for active exercise and the larger than life zoo animal motif delighted her 
1,No matter how many cars are in line they get you through pretty fast when I got to the window I wanted to get an extra order of fries and they told me they couldn t sell them to me 
1,I only eat breakfast here now but when I get my hot caramel its a hit or miss Sometimes its perfect days taste like dirty water but they will correct it 
1,I had to get out of the rain and service was really quick 
1,The ice cream is the best But the Hamburgs are to small and the frys the make are the best as long as there Hot
1,order was wrong but staff made it right and free burgers and fries
1,Son loved his happy meal this is the zoo McDonald s it is great it has fake animals and animal pictures everywhere
1,Would be slightly better if they paid more attention when you order Still pretty ok if you like the sounds of the zoo to follow you to lunch 
1,There is a new zoo animal added to the front can you guess what it is the service was gr and not a long wait 
1,Service is needing improvement car s backed uP in drive thru 
1,All order was correct and made quickly Ordered chicken sandwich Fries were burned Staff friendly busy stop 
1,The phone still taste good but the services gotten pretty slow I love all the inside playgrounds for the kids on these hot days
1,Always quick to get you served One of my favorites 
1,A Mickey D s outside of the zoo Brilliant And then to have it zoo themed perfect other than the shake sound scaring me while I ate 
1,Good coffee they didn t have the donut sticks I was craving for that s why I gave them stars
1,Keke is the best i appreciate her great service kindness n patience Young lady with a great future ahead Thanks KEKE
1,Very good pretty punctual there s some issue with the ordering ordering screen and the timing of all of that 
1,Noise of animals is scary There should be warnings aside from the cheetah print booth seat decal Beware 
1,Good place to eat at if you re on the go I like the sausage biscuit w egg and it s good

1,It was prettier when I had the animals recently I went and the lady who was cleaning bothered me because she was complaining about her work with hints as if I had dirty everything and be careful I always pick up my garbage and my children s even when we arrived we cleaned the table where we did not sit because it was dirty and also when I was leaving in the bathroom I found her again and again with her hints what a pity with this lady
1,Quite a resort I asked for Ketchup and they only gave me a bag for hamburgers and nuguets
1,It was very good they served us quickly very efficient
1,The place was very clean nice and we got our food quick but our order was not complete and the guy got upset and mad when we asked for the rest of our order 
1,Great fresh food prep One of the best McDonald s I ve been to Unruly school kids ruined the experience
1,Went thru drive thru and food was served fast and correct 
1,Fairly clean majority of the time I guess that depends on who s working But the customer service is pretty fair in all my experiences here For a quick bite I prefer this specific McDonald s Food is always fresh And I never have to ask for napkins 
1,It s a very nice renewed place It s a shame that some homeless sleep inside the restaurant
1,Here you can order from a big touch screen and they bring the food to your table It s also possible to order in advance through the app and they bring you order to your car 
1,everybody screams on their own table It s not employees fault but environment terrible 
1,For a fast lunch on the go try a 
1,When your hungry it s the place to go 
1,Be sure to keep eye contact with who takes your order otherwise with the slew of Uber eats orders coming in by the second your order can easily become either relegated or dropped in priority Craving ice cream Ask them to make it last in your order for if you re waiting you might as well have ordered a milkshake being it will be pretty molten Overall the staff have changed for the better and their service continues to get better and better 
1,Solid dive bar with good food The chilli is excellent I had a salad which was decent too You can smoke inside which is a rarity these days Nice staff who are attentive and friendly in doing so It s in an odd location for sure 
1,Place is very clean The new way to order with the touch screen is very cool very modern The food is exactly what you would expect Very tasty The only downside was that you can only get napkins from one place near the kitchen so you have to get up to get them 
1,Good staff and good service
1,Overall a decent McDonald s Clean and fast 
1,This is what I call one of those places the food quality is always good it s the people inside specifically sometimes you have homeless sitting at a table or a very loud bunch of drunk adults kids I don t mind that s what they are suppose to do there is nothing they can do but I still get my order and eat at my scooter outside not fun but what can you do 
1,Great service
1,McDonald s is cool with me big breakfast is always really good McChicken sandwich and maybe a quarter pounder or two other than that yeah it s McDonald s
1,McDonald s is McDonald s This place is good for the Children the young peoples not for a old guy like me I just went there to buy a black coffee

1,If the app gives you the option to select a table THEN THEY TAKE IT TO THE TABLE They still get annoyed because they called me by the order number when I was sitting at the other end and didn t even notice until I complained to them minutes later Either they correct the app or better train the staff 
1,The place is nice and it was clean Mc Cafe very good
1,Good place very good attention
1,The employees lack customer service skills and are very slow preparing food The self service line was long and the attention inside was almost non existent The food was fine 
1,It is unpleasant that they are constantly towing cars in your parking lot and then the owners of the cars enter the premises claiming in an incorrect way I understand that the parking lot is only yours for your clients like me but I think you should find another solution to this problem I think that behind all this there is a business with the grueros because I go to the place every day and on more than occasions just someone parks their car and in a second the tow truck appears that they have hidden in the street behind the place the service of the place is stars I will continue visiting the place perhaps they should make bigger signs in each parking lot that they should not leave the car in that place thanks for the opportunity of my comment because many times I have wanted to do it again thanks
1, It seemed that the service was delayed despite the fact that there were not many people otherwise fine clean and complying with health protocols 
1,It s very good during the day there are older Latina ladies who are very cool but not at night and the place is not so nice I m surprised that McDonald s promotions in the USA are so bad 
1,Good location and easy parking Standard McDonald s service A few sporadic beggars but nothing that bothers a Brazilian 
1,They take forever to get your order out whether it s in or at the drive tru 
1,The breakfast is the best but there are areas with a lot of tourism and only dark skinned people in any case they are never cordial
1,I received very good attention the staff at that McDonald s on US is very friendly
1,I liked their breakfast also their cheap prices and their quick service It is a good place for breakfast It will like you

1,I used the drive thru today It was quick Free off street parking lot Building was clean and well maintained To pay the clerk put the card reader outside so I could put my own card in the machine Safe I guess Food was typical McDonald s food Good Warm Not Hot Had Large with a Diet Coke Cheeseburgers and FF And a LG Soda 
1,Location was clean and modern Staff were frienldy and efficient What stood out here the most was the quality of the food preparation It was almost as if I made it myself and it tasted great Prices were good too Highly recommend

1,I Honestly can not believe that I am going to give the McDonald s in Brodheadsville five STARS They deserve it they have proven it to us over and over again The New Manager wish I knew her name has taken this location from a zero stars to getting a rating of Five Stars and I know that it could not have been easy I have picked up dinner her once a week for weeks in a row and the FOOD has been great Thats a lot considering its a McDonald s My food when I picked it up was always hot all the food was there correctly Everything was well made and put together You can tell the new manager has set the standards extremely high at this location and the employees have responded extremely well for her She deserves a big hand for caring about her staff and customers Thank You for Caring Great job Well done 
1,Great place to eat friendly staff
1,Was able to get dinner in just under minutes from the moment I entered the drive thru line that was lined up almost to to the moment I was pulling away from the window with my food My order was accurate warm neat and tasty The staff were quite pleasant to deal with and very calm despite the massive dinner rush 
1,Food was hot prepared properly and delicious The employees were all helpful and kind Place was also very clean 
1,This McDonald s in wind gap has a manager who cares about the customer and about placing a good product out for the customer The staff there is always friendly and helpful They also make sure you get your burger how you want it and stacked properly so you can eat it without a big mess in your hands and let s not forget about the hot fries I have heard her tell her employees to make sure people get hot fries Nobody does that except for her That s why this is the best McDonald s 
1, st let me apologize for butchering the spelling but Jamizia has this place on lock Been in twice recently and usually have a difficult order due to picky kids Both times she made sure my order was perfect An i still had my order by the time i was done getting drinks Her management is on point She was keeping the flow going directing staff and made sure all her guest were taken care of promptly Highly recommend this location 
1,My son and I come to this McDonald s about once a month It s usually pretty clean here with the exception of a dirty table now and then That just means they didn t get out there yet On this trip our food was great but there was this little chubby kid who was left st the table with his way young siblings He was loud and walking the baby and stressing me out I have him the EVIL EYE Hahahaha anyway the food is always good here bathrooms have always been pretty clean here too It s normally fairly quiet here and lots of high school kids in and out Chubby kid just enhanced our visit

1,This location is always running no matter what time or day The food is always fresh and the service is usually fast If they ever mess your order up they usually do right by you and give you a fresh new order This location was renovated recently so everything is brand new They no longer have the children s play area but it s much more of a sit in restaurant style McDonald s 
1,I get my combo meal once a week as a treat Food service parking is good The place can get packed at certain time of the day but have a bit of patients U will meet rude customers once in a while Good job to all those employees for their hard work to serve everyone whether its drive thru dine in take out deliveries curb side pick up etc Its just my opinion and experience with them 
1,They have good people working here The workers won t just let you stand there waiting They always see people standing there and ask what is your order number and then go look for it For super fast service DL the mobile app and order pay online 
1,Is this close to a school Lots of noisy teenagers hanging around here Other than that it has an interesting seating arrangement Just come at a slower time if you plan to enjoy your meal snack dining in I do notice the regular pricing is higher than nearby McDonald s There is lots of curbside pickup parking drive thru often busy Ask for ketchup and sauce they never give it by default 
1,Great staff members clean and little wait time
1,Fast and clean Good parking and area Why not 
1,Food was hot Service was fast and pleasant 
1,The regular parking spots were taken but there was ample mobile order curbside service parking I d never ordered that way before but it was for take out anyway An employee delivered the food within minutes of placing the order Overall it was a good experience 
1,I used the curb side feature It s excellent
1,The food was top notch and very enjoyable the inside of the place is above average in size and variety if seats and tables Customer service was amazing and the place has multiple places to order in their drive through for multiple people at once 
1,Just the right amount of salt and fat to raise my blood pressure and help clog my arteries 
1,The food was amazing I love it I mean the lady who was cleaning was being rude but besides that it was great
1,After renovation this place has become one of the newer McDonalds around Things have also gotten busier but that means fresher food 
1,Staffs are good good service 
1,Stopped by on my way to work Very fast drink was made well and food was food lol I appreciated their prompt service
1,Very fast clean and good service 
1,Always service with a smile It makes my day to see the smiles of the star who great me at the drive thru windows And yes you can see the smiling behind the masks 
1,Got BOGO Quarter Pounders during my break service was quick and the burgers tasted really good Added some extra toppings and the amount was perfect 
1,Service is incredibly fast Just done with the register not yet put back my wallet in pocket and my order is ready Workers are pleasant patience and with no attitude mostly What I like most about it is that they do not impose any unnecessary rules and restrictions on people there plus incredibly pleasant and open minded with people from various backgrounds This the best McDonald s in the area I have seen 
1,Been there since yesterday and the place looks fairly nice after it s been renovated Rating 
1,This has probably been the best Mcy D s I have ever been in years I really don t eat McDonald s much but I m glad I did today The staff were super professional sweet and down to earth The food was hot not barely warm but Hot Thank you guys

1,Recently renovated Food tastes fresh and before the pandemic shutdown the place was spotless Offers drive through order lanes for speedy purchases 
1,This particular drive through is nice and fast Its easy to get a Big Mac fries and a coke in less than minutes Staff is also very helpful all around This is one of the faster drive throughs in Queens or indeed the five boroughs 
1,Went to the location on rd and Kissena Blvd last night for the first time since the renovation It was a very nice experience The renovations was nice but most of all the staff was so very pleasant and could not have been more helpful Such lovely people Thank you 
1,This is my local McDonald s for the past years The owner manager is always around keeping her staff ready to take the next order and pleasantly The food is served as expected which is hot and delicious and the appearance of the store is upkept and maintained well Drive thru cashiers could all improve on listening well and confirming orders A smile goes a long way especially when they made a simple large w coke to be complicated After years of coming to this McDonald s I leave happy til next time 
1,There s a asian worker that like to help people with McDonald s kiosks order if you want to learn and make your order more faster by yourself 
1,They re really quick most days Have no issues redeeming offers from the app If the QR code doesn t scan they still take care of it Kudos

1,My kids favorite
1,I used to eat here when my kids were little because there is a play area just for kids Now the playground has been dismantled and redecorated adding seats designed for the elderly two extra long tables and a self service ordering screen The outdoor parking lot has also added a self ordering place and you can scan the QR code with your mobile phone or download the APP to complete the order 
1,The good thing is to take away because to eat there you refuse
1,A very cool place to share with the family
1,Excellent service 
1,I love this McDonald s location for its easy access in Flushing NY Especially since the staff is very professional and respectful and I must mention that they can serve customers in different languages including Spanish 
1,Not long after the renovation it is very clean and the service is very good I remember it well 
1,All good

1,McDonalds was great The food tastes like in Ukraine or in Europe Fried potatoes was amazing and the gave us cheeseburger liter cola and fried potatoes for It was very cheap 
1,Food is standard McDonald s but touch screen ordering is very convenient to visualize options and service was very fast in spite of the restaurant being busy Big plus that the location has thr
1,It is very clean McDonalds And stuff is very pleasant we ordered French fries online and came a little bit later So stuff changed a French fries for new warm one and we never asked about it We love this place 
1,very spacious with three floors and very clean its fries are very crispy and the service is 
1,Very good food Very nice workers the place is looking good Go there and enjoy
1,My experience was awesome like fact that is clean and futuristic Will definitely come again when I m around 
1,It is very clean McDonalds And stuff is very pleasant we ordered French fries so great
1,Busy so busy it s hard to know when your foods ready if tour not standing up there the whole time But is across from Pen Station given the area and associated expectations of large crowds of people service was good 
1,Employees were friendly and courteous Quick service and food was fresh 
1,This McDonald s is pretty okay but at night junkies tend to wander around this area Obviously not the restaurant s fault though it s worth noting I always do app orders and haven t had any issues in the past year or however long The wait seems normal to me I definitely prefer this location to the larger one on th Ave 
1,It was good There was a mistake on my order it was fixed no problem The machines were having some problems and this made the lines a little long But it was fine 
1,Great service and very clean Staff is working hard Enjoyed the visit 
1,people who take the time to review mcdonalds and give negative reviews need to get a life
1,Hot fresh food definitely recommend th ave McDonald s 
1,It s fast food what can I say 
1,Staff is very quick efficient and friendly here never had an incorrect order before Side note I m not sure of his name but thank you thank you thank you so much to the security guard that works here for returning my phone to me after it was just stolen along with everything else in my bag Went that extra bit that is much more rarely seen these days and getting that phone back meant so much more than he could ve ever known so once again THANK YOUUUUUU 
1,Did you know McDonald s has a special relationship with Coke and they have the freshest crispest tastiest Coke you can buy anywhere Try it and you ll see what I go just for Coke sometimes All soda sizes are right now 
1,It s just like them all but better they have a large turnover so everything was fresh hot and tasty very quick and very clean upstairs was pleasantly surprised
1,Busy but still giving outstanding service 
1,Impressed with the service during breakfast time When they brought the food to my table I didn t have to ask for anything Napkins jelly butter ketchup hot cake syrup silverware granola for the yogurt everything was on point and fresh Excellent 
1,The restaurant was clean and inviting The service was good not great and the food was hot and delicious 
1,Neat and clean modern
1,Not bad 
1,I did my order through the phone probably waited like or minutes mostly my fault for making the order as I was walking in so I understand the wait Everything was there which I greatly appreciate 
1,The restaurant was very clean and the ordering experience matched my expectations My order was ready in minutes and was exactly how I ordered it 
1,I would definitely recommend the McDonald s Application because you get your coffee 
1,Wanted a nice quiet breakfast there was a giant inflatable rat right out the window 
1,Got here in the wee hours and found this place very clean quiet and the staff was courteous I ordered breakfast and asked for it to be fresh and hot Glad it was made to order palatable and hot I loved being there on W th St Manhattan 
1,It wasn t busy I was attended to quick Food was good
1,Say what you want about McDonald s but this location has it figured out I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys but go here They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff Something that doesn t happen often with McDonald s but this location really was clean There was a modern aesthetic to it along with the pastries never seen at anothr McDonald s The food did take a while but considering the wait volume people I can understand Overall this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay If you re not specific about the way you like your food order at the kiosk get a table marker and go on upstairs and find yourself a table 
1,With this MacDonalds you get your food faster from actually ordering at the register with a person vs using the kiosk
1,Shamrock shakes are the best Why can t they serve them all year The vanilla soft serve cones are great too and a really good price The yummiest thing is to dip your French fries in your shake I ve been coming to McDonalds since I was a kid and it s still as good and I m still as excited to go there as always Thank you for staying the same 
1,I like that there were levels to this McDonald s They also have a security guard that you have to show your receipt to to get upstairs That should keep alot of people out that are just hanging out using seats and not eating The food was typical of most McDonald s 
1,Known food at good price Clean areas Not crowded 
1,I had a better experience here at this McDonald s they greeted me with kindness asked me how was my day and offered me a courtesy meal Without me asking I am grateful and they put this cool note of gratitude from MCDONALD S
1,As far as a McDonald s goes it gets stars for being clean and having quick service as well as surprisingly adequate seating I have not given this location a rating based upon my opinion of McDonald s in general 
1,I don t know if I m like from the th century but this McDonald s is super high tech This McDonald consists of three floors The main floor is what you walk on to it s the second floor Most of the seating is on the third floor I didn t go up to it just because I had an ankle problem and unfortunately the elevator was out The basement and area you can t get to it is where the girl is it so fancy contrapment takes your food from the grill to the second floor where you order I just thought that was cool while I was waiting around for my food They have about six self serving machines that are in front of the restaurant But if you want to speak to a human you can just walk past that to the two registers they have
1,amazing heavenly like it always is i ate on the third floor with my family and it was very tasty loved it a lot
1,My first time at this location I order some breakfast my order was taken to my table and it was fast employees really nice and helpful I would definitely visit again and I recommended 
1,First floor appear very small but it has a lot of seatings on the upper floor Looks like it has floors The place is clean and quick with order several self order booths 
1,The cashier s are welcoming and respectful The environment is clean and neat Smells wonderful and I would recommend this McDonald s to family and friends

1,Its mcdonalds
1,Even if you are not good at English you can order from the in store terminal and pay by credit card without any problems It is easy to pick up because it is called by number Although it was an eat in it was a packaging that could be taken out It might be easier in Japan too

1,The quality is good and the prices are reasonable too Even cheap by New York standards Store was clean Simply order via terminal 
1,Excellent attention in May of this year two employees treated my husband and I very badly they even spoke to us badly they even scratched our food and we argued but they are not all the same there are very good workers 
1,Good food it did not have many people and there was not a long line of people they attended us quickly the only thing is that the bathrooms open until in the morning and we arrived very early hee
1,Very good system to order without having to queue Once you understand how the app works it s great for those with language difficulties You have the option to make the hamburger to your liking I hope I apply it soon in Argentina 
1,The system of screens to order without having to speak to an employee is incredible because you save the long lines that are made and it comes in the language you want although it is only paid by card everything is very cheap and clean but they let you enter many homeless people who are a bit rude and occupy all the seats and sometimes you cannot sit down to eat because there is no place 
1,Pure beauty Fast service Agile as in most stores Immaculate bathroom And in this one there were two bathrooms Different from the Mac I posted earlier Note The attendant speaks at least languages I liked 
1,I ate in a very clean place and the ladies who serve are very friendly even the security is very nice He gave me the order thanks everything was fine

1,The food was hot The service was quick and professional Drama free 
1,Good food and kind staff A lilbit dark
1,Great customer service during my todays visit Great team work 
1,Wonderful experience Savory breakfast sandwich was exactly what I needed Orange juice had balanced sweet yet tart flavor stars 
1,We were at the next door New York Univercity store and the kids insisted on going in once they saw the magical iconic M it s been a while since we were at McDonalds this time was a pleasure the self ordering stands are amazing both to save time and to order more accurately exactly what you want I had to order for people including kids so having the opp
1,The service was quick The food is as one can can expect from a fast food restaurant but at least it s consistent 
1,Things get a little hectic here The staff do a good job dealing with some intense customers You absolutely need to check your food before leaving because things will be missing It s tempting to knock a star off because of that but the staff is always really nice and quick to solve the issue so they get a full five stars 
1,When you don t want 
1,This is one of the best McDonald s on the face of the earth 
1,Good job at night time even tho they are short
1,Unfortunately had a terrible street singer doing karaoke with a big speaker loud and out of tune its not the restaurant fault though they where nice
1,This area is busy most of the time but I have never had a problem with them Everything always goes smoothly can 
1,French fries and nuggets are well Made
1,I ordered pickup through my phone at pm and didn t know that they close at pm I felt so bad and was going to cancel my order but they said no problem They also gave chocolate cookies for free probably trying to get rid of it but hey free cookie is free cookie 
1,The golden arches they way they should be Fast easily customizable ordering at kiosk Food prepared quickly and to spec without issue Nice indoor space helpful and friendly staff This location sets the bar pretty high 
1,The service was very good and quick and my French fries were nice and hot There was definitely nothing that I could complain about I would definitely stop in again the next time I m in the area of this McDonald s 
1,Wow Finally this location an old time favorite feels like MacDonald s again very clean my coffee is always fresh and always the best when the staff is so welcoming The bathroom is much better and neat A cold Sunday but a warm place to be No loitering no drugs no pill poppers goating around Just a great comeback 
1,Quick service easy ordering Not busy when I entered 
1,They re rather consistent at this McDonald s The food obviously taste the same everywhere so I don t feel I need to speak on that aspect The workers listen and it s a quick eat everytime I go on my break so I can t complain
1,Food was good I honestly didn t really pay attention to it I just needed to order food so I could use their bathroom to roll a blunt The stall was big enough to spread out and break that loud up So I twisted and bounced but the realized I left my Swisher Pack in the stall I returned and as I was walking in a guy was coming out He had my wrap pack in his hand to throw away when we connected eyes So we talked for a second and decided to match My boy met up too and we burned down Dude musta threw some PCP on his because I was tripping balls soon after I woke up the next day naked in a field with the cops asking questions I dunno man would do again though
1,VERY Busy If Your Looking For FAST Food This ISN T The Place Depending On WHAT Time You Come You WILL Be Waiting For YOUR Food For UP TO Minutes And MOST Of The Cashier s Attitudes Are WORSE Then The Wait LOL Oh And Your Probably GOING TO Be Approached At LEAST Twice By A Junkie Or Homeless Person WHILE Your Eating BUT Enjoy The Foods OKAY 
1,Busy as heck but it does what McDonalds normally do gets you standardized food quickly without any fuss One person bathroom for customers only but two levels of seating Honestly we want here because we were burned out from a day of touristing and just wanted something to eat quickly 
1,Very clean nice friendly staff the coffee is delicious I enjoy the for fish sandwiches 
1,The place is not crowded because the staff work really fast They are so nice and friendly 
1,Very convenient location where you have NYU School NYU Bookstore subways and buses Footlocker Buffalo Exchange store Washington Square Park Joe s Pub Donut shop I highly recommend etc Lots of students around always a busy area however McDonald s is kept clean on time with food but go at a time when it s less busy 
1,Got my order quickly unfortunately had to eat outside Just spoils the experience Can t wait til this covid thing blows over 
1,It was really busy and the late night staff was out numbered but they pulled through and did a very great job I am very proud of them and also my sammie was yummy

1,Very convenient location area looks safe The staff is friendly and fast The restaurant is open hours a day The fries were very fresh and my Big Mac was perfect There are some downsides it s always very crowded and they don t take cash when paying 
1,Nice McDonald s in a high class section and the staff was friendly I enjoyed eating lunch there and sitting and relaxing 
1,Normally I do not use McDonald s for meat products on a Friday I do not have any option as a muslim and do not find any Halal restaurant nearby then I go McDonald s and try to get some fish fillet and fries some drink
1,Wonderful staff Very accommodating Food was made quick and well
1,Yummy yummy 
1,It s mc Donald s what else does one explain 
1,Of course this is my home McDonald s so I know how it works and how quick they are and how good they are and I never have a problem with this place it s not big it s just a small one in and out it s all you do I like that

1,I happen to love Tommy s but it definitely is not everyone s cup of tea Their chili burger is their traditional specialty It has meat chili tomato onions and pickle The chili seems greasy but I love it Tommy s is an acquired taste I ve been going to the original tommys since in Los Angeles at Beverly and rampart That shack is open twenty four hours a day and you basically eat outside putting your food on a ledge and standing to eat it This Tommy s is a more traditional restaurant where are you give your order inside pick it up and sit down in comfort I love that the fries are large because they hold the heat much longer than small fries I used to order extra chili with my hamburger and it made things very messy What I learned at this visit was to have the chili put on the side so I could add it as I wanted there are many different types and flavors to chili This was brought home to me one time when I was at the original Tommy s and picked up my burger and drink right after a couple They ended up eating nearby and I heard the mail of the couple exclaim That s not good chili I was wondering what part of the Southwest he was from because of his critique I just about choked on my drink when I heard him say If you want good chili you need to come to New York I m sure that there are good places to get chili in New York but that guy was probably one of the people that considers everything west of the Hudson River to be a dining desert

1,This is my go to McDonald s spot at Canal St There are seats available to sit downstairs and upstairs I like the atmosphere and spaciousness The staff working here are friendly and polite Today only you can get a free Mc chicken no purchase necessary I redeemed my free Mc Chicken it was fresh and warm when I got mine

1,I had a big Mac here and it is the only big Mac I ve ever had in me life that the meat was hot
1,It was Mc Donalds I was hoping that this Mc Donald packaging would have Chinese wrapping since this Mc Donalds is located in Chinatown 
1,They have a cleaning person constantly wiping mopping the door bathroom floor and everything else inside Very impressive
1,It s McDonald s it s fast and staff is as friendly as it gets Just don t be rude and they won t be rude The staff gives attitude to people who give them attitude first 
1,The variety of food offered by this restaurant is great They also value their customers always making sure that our needs are met and we are happy with the service McDonalds Thanks a lot

1,I have never been to such a clean place and what I ordered a big Mac this burger was exceptionally delicious I never seen such a well prepared burger since I was a kid the atmosphere was tranquil considering it was rush hour and service was great polite even someone from outside came in asking for money immediately manager came to check it out but the individual was gone by the time manager came upstairs which was very quick
1,Cool place downtown by Canal St
1,A different mcds in chinatown 
1,So just to clarify I did not actually eat here BUT I am from the south and a huge fan of sweet tea Also everywhere you go around here water bottles are around We went to this McDonalds in hopes of finding sweet tea in NYC and we were successful You have to get it from behind the counter but it was good and only for a large just like back home Cheapest drink I had our whole trip 
1,Pretty good space employees are nice and courteous Bathrooms are quite clean and all in all this place is seated built well Chairs are nice and comfortable Overall I recommend this place to others

1,At AM it is like an oasis in the desert We originally went in to use the bathroom but ended up getting soft drinks felt guilty using their facilities without buying anything filthy bathrooms but very courteous staff and interesting clientele As with all McD s NO PAPER TOWELS in restrooms BUT for what it is McD s it is star 
1,A great place to socialize with my friends
1,This is the best dang McDonald s in NEW YORK CITY It has bathrooms with stalls that are very clean It smells of Big Macs and hope What a wonderful discovery during my visit to Chinatown God bless Ronald Mcdonald 
1,The location is alway clean despite always being busy My food always comes out hot huge plus for me I ordered the fillet o fish sandwich and a small dr pepper I live near a McDonald s in Brooklyn but the food quality sucks So despite living closer to the Brooklyn location I would rather get my food from this location and travel home to eat it Lol
1,It s a McDonald as you would expect Great if you want a quick bite but if you want a good meal go somewhere else This location was just fine Service was great and the food arrived fast 
1,I have to admit to be so late and night and cheating on my never ending diet the McDonald s was clean friendly fresh fries and so welcoming Now I cant say this for all McDonald s but I had to share it was a very pleasant experience 
1,I like the new upgrades to this store Food comes out quick I just hate all the homeless people and the random drunk fight also homeless that happen here I got knocked around for no reason once

1,McDonald s is always clean and serves fresh fast food
1,Was there with my year old kids meal piece chicken nuggets I was attempting to use the kiosk when one of the employees a young lady came immediately to assist She explained the process and took me to a register to check out Within minutes I had placed my order and had my food Wonderful service though there were a lot of customers Wonderful experience 
1,Normally all the Macdonald s are the same They have to keep the standard what is the Franchise of the Macdonald s request from who is getting enter to be one the franchise one For me the best item they have in their menu is the French fries I love to Go around the many places in the world And enjoy one of the fries Sometimes they introduced a new drink Now they are getting innovated and you can order your food in the internet Delivered to you by IFood 
1,I wanna hug whoever made my order AM because the fries were so crispy and quarter pounder was perfect
1,Love to get my breakfast from this Mcdonald store The coffee and tea is the best I also like their pancakes and sausage 
1,It was crowded it s New York tho but the security guard was always making sure people to use the mask and it was fast even with the amount of orders On time good food right order Simply Mc Donalds 
1,You usually don t associate McDonald fast food with good quality but with this shop you really have to The design of every thing was actually elegant in a way and the service is quick and polite And you have to believe it when I say the burgers in there actually looks like the ones being advertised on TV all the time The taste and qualities of the food are out of for me
1,It looks crazy outside because of the people but very clean and put together inside Security is on point Felt very safe waiting for my food

1,The service was quick and easy
1,The people at the store we re so rude The manager was keeping her cool Good job Once I actually ordered my stuff came out fast and correctly 
1,Well this McDonald s has been known through out the City as not recommended place to eat but that s are people Opion I ve known this places just like anywhere else as far as people coming in and starting problems Any way this place I gave it a cause the employees are very respectful clean when you oder there s a couple of employee s that I like to mention Mr Noe is a young man that does almost everything behind the counter very respectful fast worker is important in a fast food business Next Rosalva is also a very respectful employee she works behind the counter greets you with a real smile not only welcome to McDonald s and a fake smile you could tell the difference Third is the one that runs this place is the manager Maria She makes sure everything is in tip top shape for the Customers friendly always trying to meet the customers request also with a great to come

1,Quik service and food was exellent
1,Staff that is both courteous and knowledgeable Food always tastes fresh I like that they have two ordering stations so that you can still enter and exit as quickly as feasible even during busy times I always make sure to stop by and get at least a strawberry sundae whenever I m in the neighborhood It is worthwhile to visit the location to acquire a snack or meal 
1,Best McDonald s I ve ever been to Absolutely best double quarter pounder I ve had at a fast food restaurant I m beyond impressed with the speed and quality I experienced here I bit into my burger and thought I was anywhere other than McDonald s I was taken back by how great it tasted 
1,Update I visited this location again around the same time and the food was hot and fresh Ordered chicken nuggets fries large drinks and apple pies We had to wait minutes for the pies which is understandable because they take awhile and they don t usually have that many of them just sitting around Went pretty late at night close to AM and the fries were surprisingly hot and my Shamrock Shake wasn t melted I did ordered using the app and had zero issues It was an unusually pleasant McDonald s experience and I will be a repeat customer at this location 
1,Best and most consistent McDondals in the Bay Area Their nuggets are always crispy fries is always hot and burgers are always juicy 
1,This McDonald s is always fast and polite and they always get my order right 
1,Very good as always and all the staff are very friendly specifically the manager Maria Villaviray 
1,Can you say fast Double drive through lane getting stacked I went in instead Dining areas closed but clean and safe ordering from counter The guy on cashier was fast and efficient I don t need to be treated like I m spending so the efficient process works for me Food was as expected for any McD s if you have little time and crave the golden arches this location will have you on your way soon enough 
1,Very friendly and professional staff Food tastes fresh all the time i like the fact that they have ordering stations so when its busy you can still get in and out as quickly as possible every time im in the area i make sure to stop by and get at least a strawberry sundae the place is worth stopping by to grab a snack meal 
1,Great for a quick snack the plaza near it is absolutely amazing they have great stuff over there I would recommend sometimes the staff can be iffy but that 
1,Never had an issue They get the orders right and they are quick and polite 
1,I come here a lot because I live close by The staff are really nice people friendly and open to talk with customers when it s not rush hour Sometimes I stay here for an hour or two I watch people come and go Sometimes it s packed sometimes it s only me with my family and other person There are a lot of seats and there are high chairs for kids Sucks that they cut out the power outlet a while back though I must come with fully charged device or a power bank 
1,I like McDonald s McChicken sandwiches and their Sundaes its delicious I also like the way how they packaged their food Delivery its sealed with a security tape both drinks and food inside a secured paper bag with handles Best Fast food well safely secured in these challenging times when Coronavirus is ravaging our population and its health All fast food chains should follow McDonald s safety packaging procedures for food packaging deliveries 
1,Freshly fried fries Order ready quickly Friendly staff

1,McDonald s 
1,I went on Saturday to eat and I was fascinated because all the food was hot plus the service and the speed left me speechless 
1,Fast and accurate service
1,Excellent place to spend Laayoune vacations
1,It is the ideal place to get out of the rush for a moment to enter and eat any of its products that are good both in its food and good and fast in the attention 
1,I had an excellent experience in this place the girl who served us at night through the drive thru was super friendly and cordial she gave us information about what we asked her and she explained everything with pleasure highly recommended
1,I liked this McDonald s because it has a park for the children Little McDonald s have that

1,I love the good attitude of the employees
1,I ordered a big mac and it was spectacular as always the chips were too good
1,a standard Mcdonald store but they quickly noticed the error in the totem there is a children s play area 
1,Very good as always Oh and in the one you visit you can eat inside the premises 
1,fast here
1,I was doordashing at the time I would never eat at McDonald s because I m Vegan Just want to make that clear This experience was not the best demonstration of a streamlined or very efficient process in expediting fast food The order I was waiting on took a whooping minutes and was given to someone else without an apology That being said I would have rated them with star but I decided to walk in and watch the process The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order The average gluttonous starving American that eats at McDonald s behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance It s one of the best examples you can witness of bloated self entitlement McDonald s employees you are doing a good job and on behalf of the Jerry Springer audience members that eat at your restaurant Please forgive them 
1,I came right at closing time and the manager took my order then when I got to the first window I was told sorry we are closed I told him someone repeated my order and went to ask at the same time the manager came to the first window after telling his coworker the situation the manager hurry and got payment then hurried back to round up my order while everyone else was getting ready to leave he then got my order to me fast and fresh I couldn t have been more pleased with the service and the good attitude If the workforce had more employees like this manager the world would be a lot better place to work in
1,What is a good stop at McDonald s I don t go often but when I do usually grabbing a C combo Reminds me the old Californi
1,Excellent customer service The gentleman at the drive thru was friendly helpful and courteous 
1,Tonight I was in this McDonald s things were calm and fine Then all of the sudden some guy started yelling at the staff about customer service Demanding customer service number to complain Fine that s his right But as the lady at the register tried to help him he kept yelling at her They said that he was an officer in the Army To me that is disgraceful and highly insulting that anyone would use rank and the military to treat people like that I don t believe he is any sort of military let alone an officer And I did tell him that if he is a retired military officer he is a disgrace of a former officer To which he wanted to go out and fight me Furthering my belief he is no officer I was an E Specialist and know that he or any other member of any military force is trained to use rank or status as an excuse to belittle anyone And if you do you disgrace the uniform the military and your country by treating anyone with disrespect I ll stand up to anyone who tries s that type of behavior The staff at McDonald s was doing a fantastic job my food is delicious Thank you 
1,They didn t skimp on the sauce on my spicy Mchickens
1,McDonald s will always have the best fries 
1,I show up at at am The door was closed only the drive through was open I was staying at a hotel and didn t have a lot of options for breakfast and didn t have a car The guy working their was super nice took my order at the drive through even though I was on foot He was doing everything taking orders making the food McDonalds give that guy a raise Thanks 
1,Cleanliness is taken full care of here the thoughts of the working staff are very good 
1,Went through the drive through late at night but they were super nice even though they were super busy
1,This location was surprisingly clean Our order was made quickly and everything was fresh It was a good stop for a quick bite 
1,If you want service apparently you HAVE to go through drive through 
1,Okay I know it is McDonald s but it is a very good fast food store For the price the quality is good I also like their app 
1,It s great close to work quick and always fresh
1, stars for consistency If you like McDonald s you ll like this location If you re not a fan this location wont win you over it s McDonald s 
1,Drive through only Lines run fast Food is fresh and Hot Love the celebrity meals 
1,Food was good and came quickly Staff friendly 
1,Had a company party here and they were very friendly about accommodating of us TBH none of us were expecting much from the food and we were all quite surprised at how good it was Well do this place again and also add it to our lunch rotation 
1,This place sucks they worrie about drive through and leave the lobby wit people wait for their food for more then mins my kids were hungry gave us the wrong happy times I will never go back to this one I am givin it stars jus so people will be able to see the review
1,Loved everything from the service to the food Between the promotions and coupons I save money The loyalty points build up then I can get a free item Today O had a large mocha frappe Yum
1,The food was good the price was reasonable and the people at the drive thru were very kind We got through in a reasonable amount of time We did not use their playground this time but from past experience I can say that my little one really does like it quite a bit To the point I can barely get him away 
1,I do not know what it is about this location but their coffee every time I go is so damn good Their morning crew must be fire Not gonna lie fast service not crazy friendly but fast and breakfast has always been in point 
1,We ordered and got it it was hot and right
1,Food was good for McDonalds but the crewmembers seemed a little distracted
1,I don t personally eat here my kids eat the fires and it 
1,A much nicer experience than the MCDs on as review weeks or so ago Staff seemed content being their and the food was cooked No complaints here
1,Such a great location with fast efficient service It was am when I went and I m sure the employees were tired because it was so busy but Angel and Anthony at this location specifically were SO nice and happy They were friendly complimentary and just overall made the experience Usually McDonalds is notorious for giving sub par experiences but this one was incredible 
1,I love this location cuz it s downtown so it s always super quick 
1,Placed an order in the APP and it was ready in a timely manner 
1,Went there around pm Was expecting old food and cold fries but was delighted to find hot fresh food The manager on shift made sure I got all of my items Made my night 
1,Had a great time here Maria is the assistant manager and was kind and helped me and got everything I wanted fast 
1,In that whole area that is the best McDonald s they have extremely and friendly employees there very personable The drive thru is very fast they are very friendly they repeat orders back to you asked if you would like your receipt ask how your day has been The parking lot is very clean considering that that area has a lot of problems with litter Their sodas are always refreshing and cold they don t ever taste watery they put together their hamburgers meet me so the Patty or the sauces are not dripping or the patties falling out of the bun I very much recommend this McDonald s than any other McDonald s in the area 
1,Drive through only right now but the wait was short The cashier order taker was efficient and friendly McDonald s is still a great value with fun food choices Enjoy the flavor without Covid exposure 
1,McDonald s as most people already know is one of the most popular burger places At this location service was pretty good and everything but the thing was that when we got a happy meal the box was the Eternals theme but the toy was from Encanto I really don t know if they want to make a superhero magic mix 
1,Pretty solid McD s This one honors the liberty card which gives a free matching sandwich with 
1,where do I start in the past and present they help me with coin free food coupon or no coupon like buger king the youth and all ages help and work together they even accept older coupons I went to many taco bells let s see I think the corporation are with KFC there have been nice to me mostly when I m so tired and just want one or two items like McDonalds they wait even when there in a hurry I so need that when everyone wants to push through life and I know each day is a blessing I m so sorry if I combined other types of Corp with Mc Donald s it s hard to remember all who what I don t know how many charters this is I just wanted to say I m glad people have work all over the world and people buy food and give to others also I hope they increase the fast food as well as resterants workers income very soon they feed us when we re tired and food is to expensive it helps the farmers with there crops around the world sad to say so many states get hit with disasters and there goes fast food and fun eateries that s all everyone take care and let s keep loving our neighbors world wide agape sister rogers
1,They have implemented the self order kiosk machines and the newer soda dispensers with the touchscreen Restaurant was clean and everything was in order Didn t have much interaction with employees there but they seemed nice Overall great experience Especially for a McDonald s restaurant which isn t generally somewhere you go for a good customer experience I was pleased with my quick visit
1,What can I say it s McDonald s but at least when I ve gotten food here is been got and as fresh tasting as one could ever hope for with fast food I hate cold fries but I ve never gotten any from this store I ve also never been treated poorly here so I have no complaints at all 
1,Sometimes there s a line here around the lunch over her dinner hour but they 
1,You guys won t believe what just happened Hubby I went through the drive thu When it was time to pay the guy told us the car ahead of us had paid for us I ve heard of these things happening but not to us It is December but I have no way to tell these good people of their immaculate timing What those nice people don t know is I m diabetic and my blood sugar was crashing cuz my car suddenly broke down a block away Just when the cashier told us of the kindness the tow guy called he was one hour early I didn t even see what type of car the kind people drove or get to wave thanks I must add that my fish sandwich came with the extra sauce and the French fries were piping hot Perfect ice in the drink and the right mix too They even gave us extra napkins Can I just say a very humble thank you to all involved 
1,This is by far the best location in the valley Customer service is always great The staff is always very friendly and the wait time isn t that bad at all I m always satisfied with this location 
1,Went at about am and ordered at the drive thru Was very impressed with their service All of my food was fresh and it couldn t have been a better experience Great job 
1,The two employees running the store the evening I went were completely overwhelmed and yet still managed to give great service with a smile These guys deserve a raise 
1,Ice cream cone was perfect MC DONALD diet coke is the closest thing to coke zero since they calibrate their machines for a perfect soda and purify there water THANK YOU MC DS
1,Got me a good breakfast for the whole famz for a good price Haha and I have the app so I made enuff points to get me a free big mac haha 
1,I like the way they do the egg McMuffin with sausage here I think it s just the muffins aren t toasted so much so they re a little softer everything else seems fresh and tasty This one happens to have a bunch of one way streets around it but soon as you know that you can figure out how to get in and out Fast service in the Drive Thru no complaints 
1,Went thru the drive thru around am on a Saturday morning The attendant who took my order was very thorough and most importantly very friendly When I was handed my order by another very friendly attendant my order was correct fresh and delicious Best McDonald s service I have ever experienced Thank you team for starting my morning right 
1,Friendly staff Was even offered a position Yet I could not accept due to my being homeless at the moment 
1,So you pretty much can only turn right leaving this mcslappys so we always just go a lil farther down freedom to watch the sk boarders while we eat Heads up the spoons for the mcflurry are not also straws I feel like i kill a dolphin everytime i get one ain t no way that spoon takes less than billion years to decompose If you take the bottoms off two basic hamburgers and slap them boys on top and bottom of a chicken sando you get a McOreo 
1,Probably the fastest most simple and delicious experience I have had with McDonald s so far The management is on top of it with the system they have going I really respect that after the many disappointments I have had with McDonald s before They know what they re doing at this location It s great 
1,They are so fast here I m kind of picky so I order my stuff without this or with that and they get it right every time and keep the line moving Friendly people too 
1,really this is a star review this McDonald s is located downtown salt lake city and everyone who lives here knows that parking downtown is almost impossible sometimes Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonald s way bigger than what the store needs so people try to take advantage of McDonald s by parking here and going elsewhere For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted they were obviously trying to take advantage even if they were McDonald s customers There s signs posted all over that are plain as day stating minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE so for everyone else crying try reading the freaking sign You know those metal signs cost money and they weren t custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes use your brains on another note I visited here my first time just now food was as expected for McDonald s but it s not like a good cook could make that any better staff was fast friendly and effective And my order was accurate a star for closing the lobby at night but once again I don t blame them There s a lot of crazies out there especially in the midnight and early morning hours 
1,This McDonalds was the perfect way to end our night at the Quarters bar Their staff was friendly and fast and they had the new pokemon happy meals even though we came at in the morning We even got the rare holographic pikachu pokemon card as a toy in the happy meal 
1,Employees this time are little less stressed Also the new look of the store compared with the old years old one makes everything else easier even dealing with those always non conformist customers
1,The franchise is good Years ago when I ate there regularly the owner would be there often she worked onthe line and if you didn t know her you would never know Went back recently I don t know if she still works in the store but it was as good as I remembered
1,They have cleaned it up There is a security guard who works for McDonald s to keep the riff raff out Its clean nice and calm I definetly recommend going here There is no locks on the bathroom even I was impressed and will go back when I m downtown again 
1,The girl taking my order at the counter had a few suggestions on ordering that saved us some money 
1,Never gets my order wrong always tastes great
1,I love the dollar menu Spicy McChickens all the way I can get of them for the price of one Big Mac Not that I do that that s too much I usually get two and some sauces to add to them Tastes great and fills me up 
1,Got a dozen hot chocolates to go to take to the homeless youth center and they packaged them so they were so easy to carry The youth appreciated them Thanks 
1,work here Most dont know but we have a new store manager and I hope this manager keeps everything more organized What most people don t know is that the other manager never put the effort needed for the store therefore most slacked off I ve worked here about to months and like it so far but some managers aren t the nicest me I ve been working for Mc Donalds for about a year I come in everyday with a smile on my face no matter how bad my day is I read these reports and think these bad employees managers make not only themselves look bad but me too I will continue to have great customer service most people get mad we take too long the Damn store has broken appliences every week yeah they should replace it but won t just keep repairing it till its done anyways point being very disappointing knowing we still get a bad review when I try hard to make everyone happy Thank All y all Javier Elizondo
1,Ordered ahead on the app and I could tell the staff was crazy busy but when they brought my order out the guy smiled apologized for the wait and was great about the whole situation Thanks 
1,I got delivery and it was weird he didn t follow directions But that s not McDonald s fault The food was great 
1,Good location fast service fresh fries good job guys
1,This is a fast one and they haven 
1,Its pretty good for a Mcdonalds Most of them won t serve me cookies when it gets late but this one never fails stars for cookies because those are some good cookies
1,Had to wait for RESTROOMS When I got in the men s room was clean well stocked with soap and TP The rest of the restaurant was clean and the staff was good to me 
1,I like McDonald s cuz it s quick and it s easy for me and I always get my orders right and they re very fast food is not bad it s pretty good sincerely wrapping me Daniel Robert McDaniel 
1,Crazy fast very efficient and food was actually somehow fresher than most McDonald s locations 
1,I was raised up on the west side my hole life and this is my home I have never left my phone updates so I can visit the store to get anelised my i

1,Always have a pleasant experience at this McDonals s drive thr
1,Busy Saturday morning and we were helped quickly Our order was out quick hot and accurate Great place 
1,Though there may be a wait at times the staff here are friendly and take that extra moment to make sure everything is made right I can tell that it s a very stressful job so I respect those willing to make my food for me when I don t want to do it myself 
1,Really nice very complex but simple ways to order friendly ppl great place to eat I think it s the best with the new technology all the way

1,The cashiers are very nice and the place is comfortable It s a great place to interact and the food is what is expected of Mc Donald s 
1,Having good experience on my recent visit crews are friendly and helpful At least the crews that had talked to me 
1,I stopped by on the way to work and I was very pleasantly surprised The staff here was not only out of on all things hospitality but the streaming classical music added to their warm and peaceful environment Well done McDonald s crew at this Los Alamitos location well done indeed 
1,Second position review Best cups of coffee served here n cookies are fresh n the chicken nuggets extra crispy Come check them out 
1,Came here to eat and although it was packed had a great experience The staff were very friendly attentive and clean overall 
1,This McDonald I believe this was the one down in La they are always so nice I don t even eat McDonald s right now but my uncle eats it and I go there for him to get his breakfast sometimes he likes it and they re so nice
1,They were calling numbers out of sequence and I had to wait additional ten minutes as I watched other people get there before me and they ordered way behind me I won t be going back to that one ever again 
1,Weird to review a McDonald s
1,The breakfast at McDonald s is always a hit The pancakes are fluffy and the sausage is juicy 
1,This is a very nice and clean McDonald s with very fast service and now you can fill your own soda which is a bonus Thanks Ronald 
1,The food was good and fast Dine in a bit noisy lol
1,Hot 
1,The McDonalds at this location served our order quickly and right off the grill The staff was aloof and incapable of paying any attention to the customers in the dining area I had to request napkins as they forgot to give them They gave me two I had to ask again later during the meal and again they gave me two But on the third trip I would hope te wpuld givenl me four no onlyntwo

1,fast service food was hot
1,Great service and hot food
1,Food is good and fast service 
1,My grandkids love Mickey D s
1,Mc donalds is all ways a classic 
1,Very poor customer service on the part of the cashier She ignored me while i was making a query and showed absolutely no remorse Some people need to learn manners Also the self service kiosk does not give you a recepit So you have to remember your order number 
1,Everything in south beach Miami is super expensive So when it came to breakfast the crew who rode down with me ate at the Catalina The first thing I said is where is mickey D s And they delivered Not to the hotel but delivered on that good low price 
1,It s a gritty part of Miami Beach but the staff work hard to service the varied clientele 
1,I had a coupon for a free MC ribs with the purchase of a sausage egg n cheese mc griddle and two Big Mack s We didn t get none of that anyway We got other stuff instead of popcorn 
1,Although honestly not the healthiest food to eat when not able to go find a healthier restaurant sometimes due to time and or money It s what I had to eat today 
1,Staff rude But in a central location Always busy Shows hours operational But when i reached at am they stopped me and told tomcome back at am Nut they opened after only
1,Lots of homeless people using it and asking for money not the best atmosphere
1,Nice Mcdonalads busy but I got food very very fast I reccomand if you want a quick bite 
1,I went twice when visiting and had no problems I really enjoyed t being right next to the shopping strip I highly recommend for those who come really early 
1,They actually had a working McFlurry machines and the food was good
1,Gotta Love how you pay for your food and the employees act like they are doing you a favor when you ask for your own coffee to be handed to you several times like if I m asking for something free SMH And don t ask for condiments like salt or jelly they really get annoyed nasty attitudes and all Sad how one rotten employee spoils it for the rest of the environment 
1,Hahahahahhaah Mcdonald s is always good idea 
1,Pretty funny only in miami you get guava paste and cheese pieat McDonald s im use to get apple pies at McDonald s in the midwest 
1,Best place to get a cheap breakfast in Miami 
1,Shocking that in the center of a tourist attraction where every restaurants is x the price with tax and added gratuity this mcdonalds was priced just like the ones at home Dollar menu and all No it s not the best food but you gotta give em props for not triple pricing and ripping off tourists It s weird they had triple cheeseburger
1,Clean and fast service
1,This location is always good because its in the heart of tourist location the food is always fresh and hot Its now a hang out spot all the tourist and locals and decor is nice They have soo much seating and its really spacious Ive been ordering the same thing for years The quarter pounder with Mac sauce 
1,Very clean and not too busy for a tourist town Food was good but the staff could be more approachable 
1,I really do not even like McDonalds but despite extremely crowded here I experienced was the best service I ve received in South Beach The only attentive person I met at that region was this McDonald s attendant The sandwich and the rest of the experience was exactly the same as here BR 
1,I like the braveness curiosity of Mac to try the automated standing servers I do not care if the idea worked or not but he took the risk That is what business is all about Okay guy nice location next to the touristic places of Lincoln Rd Washington Ave I gave it stars because they deserve it if u compare this location to others to other fast food places Super clean regardless of the homeless community in SoBe 
1,Well the Chicken Burger Beef Burgers Fries were the best we ve had The Milkshakes are the most delicious ones we ve ever had with all that cream on the top Yummy 
1,I am a big admirer of Bear Freaks doing man vs wild in Discovery channel From his program I have learnt about Everglades Maybe I would think I would never visit this place But it just happened without giving a thought to it So obviously I loved it I believe nobody would disagree who visited this place already 
1,Good drive through service And the tell tale fish filet sandwich was cooked perfectly I would ask people leaving the drive through to NOT come back out onto the th street because it causes havoc at that light Please follow the signs around to the left It s not that far out of you won t have to be rude and prevent people from turning right on red 
1,I normally do not eat fast food but I stayed out late and placed an order at am The service was fast and friendly The food came out correct hot and fresh Overall great experience 
1,Known as the homeless McDonald s There kinda slow and really English dosnt work well here But generally all you would expect from McDonald s Service is slow 
1,Fast and efficient staff 
1,Great place great prices 
1,Clean rest rooms I
1,The wait in the lines was a turn off but it s understandable because of it s location there s a high demand because people seek fast food something fast to eat Just like any Mcdonald s location the meal will fill you but you may want to take it to go if you die for those peaceful eats 
1,Food amazing Prepared quick and fresh Everything was sooo good Burger fresh fries fresh and hot Reminded me of McDonald s food from the s 
1,Despite it being rush hour in Miami Beach the place didn t seem dirty nor the restrooms The is no parking near the McDonalds so you d have to find a way to park yourself Customer Interaction was minimal which was good for me because this McDonalds had a purchasing mechanism for people to buy whatever they want there and receive a receipt to show the cashier and you re basically done all that s left is waiting for your food Quick Tip You are able to pay with cash if you prepurchase but the money will go to the cashier not the mechanism The mechanism does accept any kind of Credit Debit card 
1,Amazing place thank for your services 
1,Open hours and serves all day breakfast 
1,One of the best coffees in Miami

1,always a joy Clean and standard is always a charm Keeps you going back 
1,This is the cleanest McDonald s I have ever been in I normally won t review fast food places but when I use the restroom at this location it was absolutely sparkling there was also a schedule on the door on the way out that showed when and who cleaned the restroom last I appreciate it that The food was typical McDonald s good but probably unhealthy 
1,Got my order right but for nuggets I should have got at least sauces 
1,Excellent experience Went through the drive thru and met the kindest employee James Now let me tell you about James He was humorous and really made my McDonalds experience one to remember He made us laugh unexpectedly which was quite a nice surprise would recommend befriending James as he is a wonderful and positive employee 
1,One of the better McDonald s locations Clean with friendly helpful staff and even got all my orders all correct Drive through can be a little slow but its a smaller location and the staff actually does a good job making the orders 
1,First off no wait Secondly Fabiola was super nice Finally The McRibken doit
1,The food was as expected and the building new However I gave stars for the employee that I saw buy a older homeless women coffee with his own money He brought the lady the coffee and explained you cant just hang out in here but you can drink ur coffee as long as youd like This event made my dinner priceless
1,I just had a hot fudge sundae and a soda It was a very hot day and it hit the spot There was air conditioning inside 
1,This place is absolutely Epic I know this probably isn t the first time I ve praised wonderful good old fashioned McDonald s but they never stop putting smiles on my face Today I was overly stressed cuz I have too much going on and I forgot to mention that I wanted my cheeseburgers plain of course I remember seconds after they had me my completed order without any hesitation they take those two covered in sauce throw them in the trash and make me to fresh ones the way I like it Wham bam thank you ma am I ll see you soon 
1,This place is awesome it lets us Uber drivers use the restroom and we can take a break inside any time Got some cheeseburgers earlier today and a large diet Coke everything for under bucks The manager there just needs to smile a little more 
1,Donald s app is the app that keeps on giving and their mobile ordering is awesome I just barely had any money left for food the other day pull up into one of their new mobile ordering parking spots turn on the location in the phone to see what deals they going to throw at me couple bucks left on my card all of a sudden buy anything on the menu get a free sandwich mobile order only I bought myself a small shake for I got one of those Artisan Chef burgers for bucks my total I was able to have a meal with what I had and that burger was delicious I didn t even have to get out of my truck I wasn t feeling so well and they brought it out to that parking spot promptly and it was hot and fresh awesome I m loving it
1,Very nice stablishment Just got remodeled and it also has a big parking lot It has restrooms accesible with a quarter or a coin obtained from the cashier They always habe everything that is served on the menu except ice cream The service is very good and most of the people in there speak Spanish so it is a plus for those who don t speak English

1,Being that it s the first Mickey D s after you cross into the US from Qu bec Canada this place gets seriously packed at times with the Canadian tourists I saw buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here on top of the regular customers and or those that are traveling by cars Just like those working at Mickey D s over the border in the Canadian side mainly showing French these workers only spoke English and weren t too thrilled about French only customers I used the app to place my order which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more since they don t have to deal with extra people face to face My order came out in timely manner even with tons of tourists flooding in and the food was good Staff was friendly as they get Huge parki

1,VERY CONVENIENTLY PLACE SPECIALLY IN THIS STRESSFUL TIME THANKS 
1,There s nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier The prices are good as always I highly recommend the dollar menu in this case Mc chickens for only The taste is very good For the price of course And the spicy one tastes even better Service was very fast but it can get very packed in the afternoon Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well it gets packed too Pickup available The everyday McDonald s but placed in a crowded and convenient spot We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce 
1,Always clean place nice flow every time I 
1,Good place Can get crowded sometimes but the service is quick I had a huge order and was served in under minutes I love McDonald s quality so much This particular location is also right down the street from Santa Monica Pier A great place to eat before going to the beach 
1,Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonald s it able to handle the busy times In my opinion consider the customer traffic however they waist no time getting orders if you do not have a cloud following then you should get what you want Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time I see they want you to enjoy your meal in my opinion In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time I was satisfied 
1,Your service was excellent the employee Erica needs a raise because when I got there the lines were long and she cleared them out real fast thank you Erica
1,Nice place even with the homeless around it s clean and comfortable place The food preparation process is fast and the staff are nice I had tried the first tim
1,No drive thru enough parking Crowded but fairly quick They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving not stuffy Mask optional at the time July All employees were wearing masks All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job Bathrooms and tables clean Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic Indoor and outdoor tables Whenever someone got up a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table In person you can order at cashiers or use one of the self service screens I believe you could also order through the app There s a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad Didn t have to wait very long for my food Less than minutes 
1,Located on State Street in Hurricane Utah It s connected to Gas Station so this makes traveling easy for food and gas stop Has

1,One of the Best McDonald s so far Good service
1,Good location very big place
1,Doing their best for no man and the food is still the same level of addicting No drive thru and right next to the beach It is usually teeming with people and it is usually a little busy Kiosks available On this trip the payment option for me was unavailable on the kiosk 
1,Loved our family afternoon there
1,Basically what you want from McDonalds without all the bums and beggars in the store during the day
1,Friendly staff and fast service
1,High traffic fast food restaurant that doesnt fail on being exactly just that In the process however it also us one of the few places in the area that offers a no frills area to eat your food AL FRESCO And in this day in age thats priceless 
1,So busy Staff are literal heroes 
1,If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives it is very difficult to be happy Lord refresh my spirit help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest Lord You are my peace my assurance and the love that I hold on to Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more Lord I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love Be patient with others but mostly be patient with yourself Lord help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute That s happiness God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others Lord let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate Use Jesus as your example on how to live Lord You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future Give us wisdom in our choices Dear Lord thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain You don t want to see us suffer You know the suffering that we face and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end In the midst Lord I believe that you are sufficient I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness In Jesus s name amen
1,There was a psycho there but the guard tazed her
1,Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here 
1,Wonderful beachside McDonald s on Santa Monica Beach food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until p m 
1,We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them 
1,One of the nicest mc donalds
1,They got the best breakfast here 
1,The service the is great They do a awesome job with the food and it has security there so you don t have to worry to lose your chicken nuggets and hamburger also your money 
1,Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating
1,Gets very very busy but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through By far the cheapest food place in that area so ideal if you re just visiting It s still McDonalds though so don t expect anything different from every other franchise 
1,Only place that is open late night in Santa Monica after pm Service great and you know the product Very safe and family friendly Great location
1,This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier Inside is nice They will also bring food to you that you won t see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonald s only a few times in my entire life 
1,Hot and fresh I always get the Quarter Pounder with cheese mac sauce pickles and shredded lettuce only It s the best You gotta try it Kia D WeTalkRadio com
1,First thing that caught my eye was its employees within the times I ve stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark Reason being is do to it s great customer service I understand most McDonald s now have self service available to its customers but the times that I ve gone to the beach in Santa Monica it s always been alot easier to be attended by their kind employees 
1,Right in front of the WORLD FAMOUS Santa Monica Beach Pier 
1,One of the oldest piers in the country and one of the Top places to visit while in LALALand

1,Blessya all let s all get along McDonald is giving back Teenager do have a place to stay it hard on them Let s live and love Homeless is trying doing it staying clean Amen Grace keep it moving smile Sister Ms Rose PEACE
1,Joshua is cool and helpful Went above and beyond Good vibes and energy Happy guy and honest about the products Dude was cleaning the whole time and helping customer at same time 
1,The terror of the men was palpable in the air The stench of blood and bodily waste clung heavy It had been three days and four nights of terror Ever since the men had come to this island it seemed like everything had gone wrong Not just like God had abandoned them but had an active hand against them The coke here is always watered down 
1,Great customer service for such a busy location Eating area is kept clean throughout despite obvious challenges of a beach location
1,Always long lines use the app makes ordering much faster

1,Big hour service restaurant with outdoor seating 
1,Great experience Food was great the ice cream machine was working You can take the elevator or the stairs upstairs for the arcade fun Also side note I did lost my phone while here and the employee was so great I wish I had her name but she made finding my phone a priority Me and my family will be returning here again next time we 
1,Love the world s largest McDonald s Has a kids Play Place fun arcade upstairs elevator can order pizza and many other cool menu items Although usually busy service is on pace Got my meal in about minutes I love this location Found parking in about minutes 
1,The World largest McDonald s is a must to visit if you have kids Besides the typical menu items you can order pasta and pizza customized to order The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty Only downside is the wait for the food about minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it Of course the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from The place was packed when we visited Overall a good experience 
1,Hands down best McDonald s ever We loved the game room The prices were so reasonable was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted They restaurant was clean the food was fresh and staff was friendly It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant 
1,Wow Every McDonald s should be like this place in my opinion They have arcade games and a playground all in the second floor Kids love it here we easy spend about hours playing and eating and playing again All food orders are made using the kiosks on the first floor and you take a number and find yourself a table Your order will be brought to yo
1,We couldn t wait to visit The atmosphere is a little hectic but the food is amazing Definitely not food you would eat at your hometown McDonalds Highly recommend the pesto pasta and chocolate peanut butter cake Don t forget to visit the arcade and play center upstairs Watch your child s face light up when you pull into the parking lot Highly recommend
1,If you love McDonald s this is the place to go They say it s the world s largest McDonald s The menu is definitely a bit different with pizza pasta and waffles as options There was even an arcade upstairs and a elevator to get up The sign says the restaurant is open which is nice when leaving the amusement parks 
1,We had the best time visiting the Largest McDonald s in the World This place is GREAT A must see if you re in the area I had the pizza and it was fantastic Next time I ll try the pasta Staff was super friendly helpful as well 
1,Great experience We came here on a recent trip to Orlando They have a large selection of foods They also serve pizza and pasta There is a large bakery selection On the second floor you can dine at one of the many tables or play in the large arcade There is a large kids play area but that is currently closed due to COVID 
1,Came in on a Thursday night after a Magic game around pm for the first time It was crowded with adults and children The ordering lines were long and playground was full Seeing a few people with luggage and felt this could be there first or last meal in Orlando This is the biggest McDonald s in the world and the menus are different too with pizza and pasta We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good 
1,Fantastic restaurant You must visit when in Orlando The service was good The wait time for the premium menu items was reasonable It was very clean and the staff was exceptional 
1,This by far is one of the coolest McDonald s you will ever go to It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is to stories tall It has a special menu that is only designed for this McDonald s specifically which makes it extremely unique they have made to order pastas and pizzas now I went today at in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within minutes but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to minutes and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go to if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually be but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic experience when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant quality it s literally amazing to go into a McDonald s for god sakes and get restaurant quality food of this caliber my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is fantastic And it was only a little over with tax that is wonderful if you re ever in the area you should definitely try it 
1,We are in Orlando Florida celebrating my son s th birthday so why not check out the world s largest McDonald s The place is huge with people from all places checking it out too It s nd floor is full of arcade games and a children s play area They have a pasta and pizza section with a brick oven They have multiple touch screen ordering kiosks with people always in queue I ordered online with the McDonald s app and picked it up in store or else I would have waited in line The whole store is bright and clean including the restrooms One thing you like about McDonald s it s the same flavor anywhere in the world you go 
1,This is the busiest McDonald s Ive ever been to They have the process of customer care down to a science If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food over They have a pastry cafe and the play area is massive The employees are nice and gave great service Just a heads up I would avoid the drive thru between the hours of am Midnight Those are the times when people are either going or coming from theme park 
1,This Big McDonalds is a very nice establishment The staff seemed to be efficient and friendly Even better than the food was the arcade for mins of unlimited play A few games are broken but that was okay If you choose to buy credits instead you can buy things with the tickets you earn Like chuck e cheese Note The playplace is currently closed due to covid it will soon open according to my sources though 
1,This McDonald s is known as the biggest 
1,This McDonald s is definitely a must be location if you re a fan of the Big Mac the pizza is surprisingly good the staff is super kind they constantly ask you if you need help her if everything is good There s plenty of tables to accommodate everybody wait time and fast And if you re Coca Cola connoisseur the soda fountain is perfect Super clean upstairs as a full arcade really cool if you have kids definitely stop by here you have a chance 
1,This being billed as the largest McDonalds in the world I had to stop and see it It is certainly BIG They have a dessert station brick oven for pizza and huge play area for the kids When I stopped it was busy and the employees were friendly and helpful The restaurant and dining area appeared clean which is difficult to do in a high volume fast food restaurant I just grabbed a burger and shake and it was typical McDonalds 
1,This place is really busy Not your average McDonald s they serve pasta desserts and pizza at this location We waited about minutes for happy meals Only went here for the experience I will staff the staff was very professional and polit
1,BIGGEST MCDONALD S IN THE WORLD We drove by this McDonald s and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonald s in the world After googling it it was So we had to stop in It was definitely a cool experience They offer More options than just the traditional McDonald s We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent They also offer pizzas and different pastry options Like cheesecake cake ice cream specialties This is a two level McDonald s but looks to be four stories The first floor is the dining and kitchen Second floor is a large play place that s two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes Kind of like Chuck e cheese We spent a few hours here It s spent around for four of us So it wasn t that bad Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonald s in the world 
1,Pretty awesome place On top of your standard items they sell pasta pizza and pastries Surprisingly the pizza and pasta was quite good for McDonalds The place also offers a very reasonable arcade unlimited play for minutes The only draw back to the timed purchase is that you don t earn tickets They do have a trade in booth with prizes for your tickets Overall we came here for the experience of going to the world s largest McDonalds and came out pretty satisfied with the while experience Enjoy y all 
1,Dude world s largest McDonald s But it is NOT the world s largest McDonald s parking lot There was hardly enough parking for cars let alone bigger vehicles We have a ft Class C RV There is no oversized parking We got lucky with parking but others did not But seriously If your family likes McDonald s this McDonald s is worth it We ordered pizza and chocolate cake at McDonald s Cake was delicious Pizza was not terrible But the most memorable part was the second floor Not only is there an incredible gigantic three story all enclosed play place with a single entry exit point There is also an extremely large arcade with all sorts of v around a corner and can t be seen from the dining area For kids that must play a game there are dining tables with touchscreens There s plenty of seating both upstairs and on the main floor and clean bathrooms on both levels The kids will remember this McDonald s 
1,Well this was an experience It was definitely fun for the kids Arcade and a huge play area when I went to the play area was closed but it was big This McDonald s has floors and the typical McDonald s food the twist there is they also sell pasta dishes and pizza Wow I know right 
1,A nice big building that lives up to its hype The entertainment can help the kids distract and enjoying been kids again Food was good pizza chocolate cake woowwww 
1,We come here every time we are in Orlando and this was the first time we tried the pasta It was a little disappointing that you couldn t add chicken or sausage to it but was delicious nonetheless The pizza and chocolate cake we also very good The store was well maintained and clean The staff was friendly despite the business 
1,Great service and the special menu they have it s really good The pizza it 
1,This McDonald s has everything Even pizza and pasta Bear in mind that it s a little expensive if you order items individually So get the combos if you can that way you save money The place was totally renovated a few years back Nice place on International Drive 
1,Well obviously es a different place in comparatively other McDonald s but be ready to a lot of people childrens yelling and running anyways still such a amazing place they cook a good pizza that was oh Worth it 
1,For this to be the largest McDonald s I wasn t sure what to expect My daughter wanted to stop by while we were visiting It was very busy as to be expected Staff was friendly Really cool spot They even have pizza and pasta on the menu How awesome lol
1,We had an amazing experience you ordered upfront and got your number and they brought the food to you You can personalize your own spaghetti and pizza It costs the plate McDonald s food is the regular price as in all McDonald s it has a real big park upstairs and an arcade which is amazing for the kids to enjoy the only thing that I didn t like was that it was wayyyyyyy to HOT upst
1,What a mind blowing McDonald s Punch in your order on the screen pay then find a seat and staff will find you to deliver your meal Philly Cheese steak was our pick the stone oven thin crust pizza was great and the pasta considering it was from a fast food place was very good Kids loved the arcade and play place too 
1,This is the worlds largest McDonald s with the largest McDonald s play place I ve ever seen in my life Always quicker service inside i
1,I m surprised I hadn t heard about this place before but we were so glad we stumbled across this McDonald s while driving along International drive This place is amazing Not only do they have unique extra food items lik
1,Cool McDonald s They have an arcade and a pizza oven Definitely not your average McDonald s Pizza and pasta was great 
1,I ve obviously been to McDonald s before but none like this Tried the pizza and I ll have to admit it s not perfect but it s definitely not bad Crust is a little thin for me The activities are upstairs and it s like a small Dave Busters If you ve never been think about it It s not a life changer but fun to see at least once
1,I love McDonalds Not just their food but the corporation as a whole I think it s awesome to visit McDonalds in other Countries for their typical off menu items Although I ve been to Orlando various times I never knew that this city housed a different McDonald s experience I tried several versions of their pasta I also tried their cheese pizza and peanut butter chocolate cake All of these items were EXCELLENT I never thought I d eat pasta from McDonald 
1,This is the nicest McDonald s I have ever been The kids loved the arcade and the play place We got a big Mac and pasta It was very good 
1,Its most def something else Has a couple of floors You go in and go straight to some screens and make your order They have pasta pizza sandwiches Full package
1,I had always wanted to go to this McDonald s as a child but never got to years as an adult I finally got to and it didn t disappoint Coolest McDonald s ever Everything is supersized 
1,Came around pm and while it was busy they did not take long to have the food ready We used the touchscreen kiosk to order and they were super easy to use We got a pepperoni pizza and some alfredo pasta You can see them cook these which was pretty cool They have an arcade upstairs and the place has tons of places to eat 
1,Who knew Orlando FL has the biggest McDonald s in the world I didn t until this week I was pleasantly surprised This was not a normal fast food dine in meal The atmosphere was pretty cool The menu I expected I mean who can get a brick oven pizza at McDonald s Pasta philly cheese steak sandwiches frozen ice cream and customizable orders from the menu Oh I almost forgot about the arcade on the top floor But what else should you expect since the restaurant is not far from Disney World 
1,Was very busy and fast paced But the kids loved it Definitely a change from our regular McDonald s Highly recommend the cheesecake 
1,Unfortunately we didn t have the best experience here We waited almost an hour for our pizzas and many of the employees didn t seem to care Apparently they lost our order and like others It was chaos Everyone was going up and asking for their money back The only reason I m giving stars is because the manager Mashawna was super kind 
1,This place was wicked crazy I went with family and we all did our own orders and they missed at least items for every single one of our orders It was bizarre I ve never seen a McDonalds that serves pizza and pasta and has an arcade The upstairs where the kids playground and the arcade were was SO HOT It was probably borderline unsafe for how hot it was for being inside the building Especially since the kid s playplace was up there I would be afraid of kids getting getting dehydrated and potentially even getting heatstroke 
1,My family really enjoyed this place They bring your food to your table I love the different food options they have 
1,The biggest McDonald in the world is here in Orlando Florida Great space for share enjoy play kids area for lots of fun 
1,Really fun place and they have freshly made pasta and pizza There are cool desserts there to try as well 
1,The pizza is really good We got and everyone liked it About the size of a medium pizza hut pizza but oven fired yes there are stone fired pizza ovens in here and thin crust The Philly cheesesteak was really good and the chocolate explosion cake was tasty If you order to eat there and order pasta or the cheesesteak it comes on REAL plates pasta bowls Thought that was neat Not surprisingly our fries were cold and the Big Mac was missing a burger pretty consistent with all other McDonald s on that point Service was decent Our order came up in a decent amount of time considering the amount of orders they had coming in There are several different dining areas an arcade and a play place FYI you c
1,A great unique McDonald s for the first time pizza there cooked infront of you in the oven also ita largest one in USA with floors second floor for kids arcade and playground
1,Great experience Food was great the ice cream machine was working You can take the elevator or the stairs upstairs for the arcade fun Also side note I did lost my phone while here and the employee was so great I wish I had her name but she made finding my phone a priority Me and my family will be returning here again next time we 
1,I don t believe I have ever in my life been too nor knew a McDonald s would make you a fresh made to order omelet How do the say there is a first time fir everything 
1,The best thing about the world s largest McDonald s could be the pizza the cheesecake the arcade the jumbo playground all that is great but the BEST part of this McDonald s is the MacTonight animatronic mounted on the wall 
1,This place was so good we went back a second time they have pizza and pasta AND CAKE at McDonald s I rate this place one of the best McDonald s experiences ever don t forget they have a giant play area upstairs that is free as a giant Jungle Gym area and then your best bet is to pay the for minutes of arcade time and you got minutes to play all the games you want
1,This is a fun place to check out if you re in the Orlando area They have PIZZA which was pretty ok There s a arcade that my kids really enjoyed It 
1,Pizza here was actually not bad I love that u can sit anywhere and they come find u with the tracker number tents I contemplated going into the jungle gym to see if they would go in lol but anyway it was great and they have a full arcade phillychese stake sandwich and pasta Lol didn t try those but the cake slices they have looked awesome plus handscooped icecream come on no brainer just go before u leave Florida
1,A bakery a pizzeria fish tank and arcade in a McDonald s Really amazed by what McDonald 
1,Don t expect to pay the price you would pay at home at this location Although a little more pricey this trip to this mcdonalds was worth it they have a large arcade located on the second floor they have an ice cream and dessert station which serves chocolate cake and a few other types of cakes This mcdonalds offered Belgian waffles a little over ham and cheese French toast for breakfast 
1,Wasn t sure what to expect when we visited the world s largest McDonald s at am hour run however and a pizza Wowzers Definitely an experience i will not soon forget 
1,There is much more choice as in other MC Donalds to otherwise he is not the biggest in the world 
1,I was shocked to go into a Mcdonald and order grilled chicken alfredo This McDonald in Orlando Florida has a kid area and arcade They also have pizza that can be purchased It has two floors accessible with an elevator Crazy but fantastic at the same time 
1,This location is said to be the largest McDonald s in the world We stopped in after a day at Universal We arrived after and it was crazy busy Our order took at least min before it was ready but under the very busy circumstances it was understandable They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular Multi level seating games room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better Lots of free parking and dual drive thru Overall this McDonalds is a flagship location for sure 
1,This was my first time visiting this location The staff was very nice and service was great The atmosphere was very good We just didn t get to visit the second floor because the elevator was closed 
1,This is a big two floor McDonald s with not only the typical fries and burgers but also pizza salads and other foods They have a kids playground and also an arcade and game area on the second floor 
1,Very nice and freandly place to eat food A lot of space to play for children Very nice Staff 
1,Love this place There s so much fun inside After eating you can play some game the game room is upstairs on the second floor They re all types of games it s remind me
1,This is the only McDonald s in the whole United States that serves pizza I stopped here after passing through it because it looked like a beautiful building on the outside with multiple floors The pizza we had was delicious 
1,World s largest McDonald s and the only McDonald s which serves pizza Which by the way was quite nice freshly made there with a good selection of toppings available As well as the usual McDonald s food Plenty of seating available utilising multiple floors 
1,This is the largest McDonald s in the world The menu is much larger here as well I ordered the Philly cheese steak Giant playground and arcade on the nd floor Cool experience 
1,This is by far the best McDonald s my family and I have ever been to The food was prepared with love and quality The options for food was amazing I was able to get a veggie pizza that was cooked to perfection The game room upstairs was one of a kind The customer service was outstanding This will be an orlando visit every time we come to Orlando 
1,This is the coolest McDonald s ever You order on a kiosk pick up a number sign type in the number after you order and they bring you your food because the number sign has a gps tracker in it It is two floors serves pasta and pizza and also has a cake shop The kids w
1,The traditional burgers and fries were served Luke warm As busy as the restaurant was I was truly expecting hot and fresh Perhaps had I ordered the pizza or pasta my experience would have been different The service was nothing out of the ordinary however the staff was friendly The best part of the visit was the arcade and play area my kids absolutely love it we were there for hours and hours 
1,This place was amazing The arcade upstairs was superior The fish tank with the different fish was cute and how amazing was it to see a brick oven pizza
1,Highly recommended The only McDonald s like it and the largest one in the world You can get fresh omelettes waffles pizza and of course all the c
1,World s largest McDonald s It s a story location with a full kitchen serving unique dishes like pasta pizza from a brick oven waffles and more There 
1,Didn t know that this was the largest It 
1,Fun stop with lots of different options like cheese cake pizza and peanut butter cake absolutely delicious Very modern facility and cozy feel Great spot for hot coffee and a piece of cake The upstairs floor is a giant play place with arcade games as well You place your order on the kiosks take a table tag and then find your table They bring it to you If your visiting Orlando especially with kids this is a fun stop 
1,Love this McDonald s Prices was great Worth the visit 
1,Really the biggest McDonald s The food was good Bought pizza fries and pasta Kids liked it very much If you are in Orlando you should give a try here Depending from where you drive from it may be difficult to enter 
1,Wow a great place has an arcade my stepdaughter had so much fun first time was on vacation fron CT if u haven t been great to the kids 
1,It was my first time and it was a pleasant experience Surprisingly having pizza at McDonald s wasn t as weird as I thought 
1,Biggest McDonald s I ve ever seen This place was huge with so many employees and an expanded menu including pasta dishes and pizza This of course is in Orlando and open hrs 
1,That was fun Huge McDonald s Went there at pm and hung out and kids played until about pm but you would think that it was lunch time with how busy they were We were surprised at how fast the food came to our table and the staff were friendly Well done McDonald s 
1,Most unique McDonalds I ve ever been too It s huge There is a very large play area for kids and an 
1,Had to stop here on our way home from Florida My kids were super excited see this location They had fun playing in the playground and arcade and we even enjoyed breakfast before getting back on the road 
1,The food was alright it s one of the biggest McDonald s but quality can be improved with the fish sandwiches being burnt on the edges and burgers were not properly organized within the bun in the big mac just a bit of feedback compared to regular McDonald s restaurants Other than that my family had a great time enjoying the upstairs atmosphere and playground 
1,Best experience ever The food was shockingly good I did pizza and build your own pasta Customer service was phenomenal Restaurant was very clean and we didn t wait long on our food Can t wait to visit again 
1,Obviously one of the most amazing McDonald s I ve ever seen Three stories and a two story playland They had premium scoop ice cream and pasta with Alfredo on the menu Are you kidding me Pizza and Alfredo at McDonald s You betcha Biggest Playland I ve seen in the McDonald s for years Has it The classic Mac tonight guy playing a piano in the corner Has it Easily the best McDonald s I ve been to since I was a kid years ago in Las Vegas 
1,This McDonald 
1,Breakfast was hot and fresh They had an omelet sation with Belgium waffles 
1,This is an amazing gem sitting on a corner looking not much like any McDonald s I had ever seen before The second floor confused me but the logo looked similar to McDonald s They have pizza cooked there in the restaurant I know because my order was called before my pizza was ready At any rate walking through the arcade upstairs was a nice way to wait for my pizza I only gave stars for service because the staff seemed to not be trained for customer service Perhaps they were simply tired or busy but it wasn t up to the standard of typical McDonald s when I visited I will return next time I am in Orlando 
1,By far the best and most amazing McDonald s in the history of the world It s even hard to imagine it as a McDonald s Super clean extremely friendly and helpful staff A second floor with a massive arcade and crazy huge kid gym shut down due to covid hysteria Loved this place Bring your kids 
1,Not much to say that every other review hasn t Very fun for something different Watching your pizza be put into the real brick oven at a McDonald s is definitely interesting The main reason you go is the novelty but the food honestly didn t disappoint The specialty menu items are a tiny bit pricey but fast food standards but they really are a tier above fast food Overall my fiance and I had a great time and I definitely recommend checking it out 
1,This has to be one of the best McDonald s I have ever been to hands down While disappointingly I did not visit the upstairs with the arcade machines I can rave about the pasta and pizza they make and serve The pasta can rival olive garden and starts at and you are able to customize it how you want Definitely would recommend both the pasta and even the pizza I m pretty picky on pizza and the pepperoni pizza was actually pretty good I usually would HATE brick oven pizza as I find they taste burnt always but this was a good pizza Definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the area It is a little busy most times but even with that the wait is no worse than a regular McDonald s 
1,This McDonald s in Orlando is huge It was very busy but they were very fast The food was very fresh as they pretty much have to make everything to order Definitely worth a visit just to see them make pizza at a McDonald s 
1,This is not your mommas mcds This was fantastic Big huge wonderful A truly fun unbelievable McDonald s experience They have a dessert bar They have pizza and pasta a wood fired oven You have to see it to believe it 
1,Had a drive thru order for EIGHT Every meal was correct and picture perfect All the fries were the crisp and hot And the staff was awesome Best McDonald s I ve been to 
1,Fun to visit the largest McDonald s in the world Highly recommend
1,We went with our kids and of course they wanted to eat and play on up stairs so a friendly worker brought us our order but there was no station services on up stairs and the same time we had to go downstairs to serve our sodas look for napkins sauces and straws
1,This is by far the best McDonald s I love the options not on other locations menus The pizza was wonderful and freshly made to order I wish I lived closer because it would for sure be my go to fast food restaurant 
1,Chaotic has alot going on being the world s largest McDonald s many options not on a typical menu examples being pizza pasta pilly cheese steak Belgian waffles and many more a giant arcade and kids play place on the second floor which can be accessed by an elevator
1,Really awesome experience A must when in Orlando Simple It s the biggest McDonald 
1,We got out food VERY fast and they even have pizza The burger was a tad too dry but nothing I couldn t fix Service was fast for how busy it was It s also a very modern building 
1,Huge McDonald s Unique items at Orlando location Pizza and pasta Cheesecake was sold out Arcade but prize and play area are closed You can order at kiosk or wait in line for cashier Soda is not self serve free refill Expect a long wait approximately mins if you are waiting for pizza and pasta it s understandable though They do deliver to table I didn t see the Belgium waffle on menu 
1,It was to crowded but food was good and there are so many other options like pasta that you cant find in regular stores The second floor was amazing for the little ones with big playgroung and Arcade section Would love to come back on a not to busy day We visit Sunday at noon 
1,Awesome McDonald s to visit and eat The food was delicious and the customer service was great You place your order at the machine and they will deliver the food anywhere you are I love the arcade area and there was plenty of seating The atmosphere was relaxing and restrooms food area drink area and arcade were clean They have stories and both were very well maintained I definitely recommend visiting this McDonald s with your children They will have lots of fun 
1,Very loud and busy Very big inside with McDonald s pizza place too Upstairs is a big kids play place But you will have to wait about mins too receive your order So that a downside and its very crowded so if u have a problem with crowded places don t go inside because it alot of people inside ordering and waiting and it s just to much
1,Love this McDonald s it has a great variety of food I think this is the only McDonald s that serves pizza and real dessert like this peanut butter chocolate cake Check it out 
1,I came to Orlando for Disney world and ended up coming to the largest McDonald s I ve ever seen I can proudly tell my family I got pizza and pasta from McDonald 
1,I was so excited to visit the worlds largest McDonalds even though McDonalds is not one of my favorite places If you are a parent you understand Lol But this one has so many more options to choose from I got pasta and my son got pizza Both were very good They even have a separate desert counter If you have little ones you definitely want to check this place out The Play Place is huge 
1,Always super busy the pasta is mid the pizza is surprisingly delicious the deserts are fantastic the vibe is pretty fun a very cool playground and arcade upstairs with flappy bird of all things always fun to stop here when I hit Orlando 
1,MCpizza is the best item in the menu 
1,Loved the look of the store Kids had a good time in the arcade One part of my party waited over an hour for their food Went to ask about it three times and was told it was on its way The fourth time I went to the counter to ask about the order and was told that their system went down and that It had lost the order Little did they know that I currently work for McDonald s and I asked the manager how they were still taking orders if the system went down and no one was on the phone with tech support All of a sudden they found the order and rushed it to us I feel that what had happened is that the order was served off and no one wanted admit to it 
1,This was actually a pretty cool McDonald s Needed to experience it Service was quick especially with the amount of
1,I was amazed that this was a McDonald s The wide variety of items offered outside of the normal McDonald s menu was impressive When I went some of those stations were closed but if I m ever in Orlando again when there are open I will definitely try them Can you imagine getting pizza from McDonald s or ice cream 
1,The best McDonald s I have ever visited It is nice and incredibly clean At this McDonald s you can get both burger pizza and pasta something I haven t seen at other McDonald s On the first floor there is a large play area for children and an arcade However one must be aware that because of the play area there is some noise on the first floor But far less noise in the ground floor 
1,Food was good and service was great
1,Different food options from the traditional mickey D s but we went for the arcade Can easily spend a few hours here on a hot or rainy day and not break the bank 
1,A big and busy McDonald s with more choices than usual 
1,If you haven t been here you need to see it Updating Review this place is still very interesting definitely bringing the kids food hasn t changed pizza is fantastic 
1,Biggest McDonald 
1,The staff treats people like an actual customer There everyday practically doordash driver Amazing staff One thing I hate is having to mix my own flurry when they usually mix it up for you Other than that little flaw I definitely feel safe Welcomed No rude staff When their busy we have to wait a H for the food when their not we get our food within minutes Surely recommend bringing small kids to the play area 
1,Multi level place Loud but fun Like a Chuck E Cheese inside a Mickey D s Lots of games on nd level Plenty of tables Fast service Kiosk fairly easy to order pay 
1,Even though the stars make no sense on my review the experience of a different McDonald s is definitely worth it The place isn t the cleanest service isn t the fastest or most efficient and the atmosphere a bit frantic it s worth a visit to have a pizza or decent diner breakfast from McDonald s Worth the experience 
1,This place is crazy packed Our food came out at a decent time It s worth a stop to experience it Just be prepared to be in a crowd 
1,This location is a joy I have been going here when im in Orlando for years first with my kids and now with my grandkids The way it is laid out it is very customer friendly And the kids just love the play area and game room upstairs To this day the staff continues to be very friendly and helpful 
1,The food is good But they are understaffed and struggling to provide food on time It takes hours even to get a slice of cake or coffee For pizza the wait time was horrible 
1,The place was a little dirty and it took almost minutes to get our food But they had a good variety of food My teens still want some more McDonald s pizza
1,My kids love the indoor playground The whole place was sticky sweaty and stinky I don t know what s wrong with the a c but a lot of people could be the reason Keep your kids close at all times 
1,One of the world s largest and most interesting McDonald s Located in the busy area right in the hub of Orlando off of iDrive This is a two story McDonald s hosting some of the world s rarest menu items including both pasta and pizza and a ton of cakes and other amazing trees A great place to visit if you re looking for something fun and interesting in Orlando If you re a fan of McDonald s this is the one you re going to want to check out Although it is always very busy because it is in the downtown tourist hub right near Universal Orlando I drive and many other great tourist destinations This McDonald s features both counter service and has multiple kiosks of available so you can go up and order easily There is a drive thru available This is currently the only place in the world serving McPizza with several options available as well as customizations This is also one of three places in the world including the Philippines and Italy that are currently serving McDonald s pasta Definitely an interesting menu item to try out if you re looking for something a little different They also have a full ice cream and cake shop with plenty of dessert choices Upstairs host a full gaming arcade with air hockey skiball arcade games and a ticket area to collect prizes once you re all done If you re looking for an interesting affair and a little bit of a different McDonald s experience this is the place to visit 
1,all food was good but pricey 
1,It was pretty cool for a McDonald s They should all be this way It s kind of like Chuckie Cheese with the arcade upstairs The pizza and pasta were good 
1,This is the best McDonald s in the country The service is on point They are friendly and always looking to make your experience here better The place is spotless As for the kids this place offers a story playground along with video games But what makes this place special is the staff in particular Perrin This gentleman is at your service with a smile and a great personality I can t say enough good things about this place You need to relax and let the kids go after a long day at the park This is it 
1,The rooms were a nice size The place was very clean rooms bathrooms refrigerators dishwashers and pool w sauna attached to the house It was completely furnished from plenty of towels to dishes I will most definitely be back Oh and did I say the maintenance staff was very efficient one call that s call Two family rooms w plus inch T V s and inch T V s and up in each bedroom 
1,First of all keep on mind this is McDonald s a very upscale McDonald s but it is it My family and I really enjoyed it here It was very clean although crowded assistance was given with processing our order and the employee explained how I can get a discount through the McDonald s app he was very patient It is very large and the game room was great The other employees were very nice and took our trays and trash The was McDonald s flavor but the pizza was good The cookies were so fresh and warm very delicious More than the regular McDonald s food options Overall a great visit 
1,Highly recommend Pizza was 
1,I never imagine we could eat a great pizza pasta and Philly Cheesesteak at Mc Donald but the true is they are amazing a must try if you visit this specific place 
1,It s the largest McDonald s that I have ever been to It has a second floor that has an arcade and a quiet side for those who prefer technology The menu is huge you can get just about anything from your typical Mc care to pizza and great ice cream desserts 
1,I dint get to go up stairs But it is well kept and so dang busy The fishes seemed hungry and lethatgic
1,Best McDonald s I have ever visited This is one of the few McDonald s in the USA that still serve pizza On top of the coal fire build your own pizza they have custom pastas and build your own omelets The jungle gym for the kids is huge and they bring your food right to the table The trash cans are automatic as well as the seat covers To add icing on the cake which they also have at their dessert bar there is an arcade with a prize table This is honestly the best McDonald s experience I have ever had 
1,If there is any McDonald s world wide that deserve a five star rating then this is the only location that must get it McDonald here offer pizzas subs desert bar kids playing area with arcade amazing service 
1,The biggest in the world My sons loved it I took them to a trip to DisneyWorld and they keep saying they want to go back to the biggest McDonald

1,It was fun checking out the worlds largest McDonald

1,One of the best McDonald s in my travels Great food and great customer service And the only McDonald s that I know that serves pizza and more If you re heading to Universal and Island s of Adventure make a stop at this McDonald s 
1,The kids play area it s speaks for itself can take your child they will play for hours foods good and many options to choose from pizza and a friendly staff
1,Pretty chaotic inside during dinner time Not a quick trip Plan to stay a little while Pasta is ok Alfredo sauce was a little bland Your able to customize your pasta with different meats and veggies but be prepared to pay an extra each on top of the pasta already starting at Pizza is phenomenal Thin crust but not too crispy and very flavorful All of your favorites like normal but with an actual working ice cream machine 
1,The worlds largest McDonald s is amazing a two story playland plus arcade games and an updated menu where you can choose waffles build your own omelette pasta and pizza plus delicious desserts It s a great place to bing the kids on a relaxing day on Orlando don t take my word come see for yourself 
1,This is probably the best looking McDonald s with a variety of different food options from burgers to pastas to desserts Don 
1,This is the best ever McDonald s the sheer taste of the burgers is like nothing I 
1,Big place haven t seen a McDonald s like this one two floors to eat and play its like a McDonald s and a chunky cheese in one recommended to every one if your in the area

1,Pizza wa excellent Pasta was good but peppery Normal McD food was similar to others 
1,Not your regular McDonalds and this model would be cool to spread across the USA Pleasent staff clean attentive aware of needs PERRIN WAS A GREAT Host Made our morning awesome we will be back next year when we are in town for the PGA show 
1,Great food Staff is amazing unlike any other Mcdonalds you would go to Better to come here not during its peak
1,Lovely meal I ate inside Staff was pleasant and was available to assist with the ordering board A cash registered was also available If you choose not to order from the display board Love it 
1,This is a really awesome Macdonald s Not like any other Truly unique It offers a lot especially for kids with an aquarium slides and gaming areas Technology is awesome with individual kiosks for placing orders and service is fast and friendly We enjoyed it Plus they serve pizza All the benefits of the usual McDonald s with bonuses It s also very clean and modern 
1,Best restaurant we went to in Florida Yes I m serious Went to restaurants and McDonald s was the best one Kindest waitstaff great food clean eating area All around Best restaurant experience 
1,Lots of different things on the menu Kinda cool if you need a snack on vacation Probably won t spend much time here
1,The gold standard for all McDonalds and on to of that you can get pizza and pasta You order from the kiosk and take a tent number get your drink cups from the cashier and find a table Your food will be made to perfection not exagerating all of our food looked as good and put together as it does on the menu photos There s an arcade on the third floor stop in if you have a chance you won t regret it 
1,One cleanest McDonald s I ve ever been inside to eat in Very fast service pizza was surprisingly good I would eat here any day 
1,Hard to believe this is a McDonald s Beautiful building and they even have a brick oven for cooking pizza They also have a dessert bar and an aquarium Even if you don t really like McDonald s food it s cool just to check it out 
1,Best McDonald s I have ever been to it has an awesome game room like Dave N Busters Kids win tickets to exchange for cheap toys It has a large play gym with multiple slides computers at tables for ordering or playing games iced cream bar etc 
1,Sat upstairs Brought food to our table No drinks machine upstairs kids Had to go downstairs to get drinks Then realized they messed up my order Still a good experience Note Large family sit downstairs 
1,This is a great family place you can let the little ones run around the place is so clean and sanitized This McDonald s has a pizza restaurant within the same building as well so I find that to be a bonus McDonald s service was friendly and fast and fresh so thanks 
1,World s largest McDonald s that serves PIZZA PASTA Deserts you cannot get at other Mickey D s plus an awesome playplace for kids separate toddler area Arcade inside has quite a few machines game cards c
1,Good is the Mac more large in the 
1,Very busy but It s nice and different types of food From cakes to pasta and even pizza Had the pizza and chicken alfredo they were surprisingly good and easy to go down Doesn t compare to a good restaurant But if your craving pizza or pasta can t go wrong
1,The world s biggest McDonald s doesn t disappoint My son was so excited to see they had Wood fired Pizza
1,The McDonald s pizza is surprisingly good This particular restaurant is gigantic and well staffed meaning there is always plenty of seating and service is quick and accurate This is a fun stop when in Orlando especially if you are heading east after visiting the Diz 
1,Was very busy But food was great and made quickly We didn t get a chance to go up stairs because of the crowd but the kids enjoyed the fish tank
1,Great experience I got my pizza fast and overall it was great the pizza was well made 
1,Ok it s complicated Its always crowded because of its location but this McDonald s is just unique I believe the biggest and if you enjoy McDonald s you are going to love this one And the pizza and pasta yes you read correct is delicious Its like there own recipes and they got it right 
1,The pasta was incredible It was a fair price and the flavor was on par with other more expensive pasta resturants Overall great experience the service was good and the restaurant looked clean No complaints 
1,Has to be the best McDonald s I have been in They say the World biggest Mcd 
1,This is the biggest McDonald s in the world has an upstairs with arcades and child s play area Menu is extensive with pasta pizza omelettes and all day breakfasts If you visit Orlando and like a cheeky McDonald s be sure to visit here 
1,Very clear local kindly staff and I loved the pizza
1,Fun tourist feel Kids will go crazy Nice small arcade Please ask the crew for help in cashing in winnings they don t have a separate team working the arcade 
1,Food was great and they even served pizza and pasta Multiple stories with playground and arcade games
1,Best McDonald s I ve ever been to Good quality food especially for a fast food restaraunt This McDonald s also had a very fun looking game room 
1,You don t see a McDonald s with two story anywhere until you come to Orlando Florida Just because of the size I forced my family for us to eat here They had a whole arcade area pizza line etc You have to check it out when you visit Orlando 
1,They forgot to give me cup for my coffee after waiting half hour And when I went to ask for refund They gave refund without any hassle and also offered free Apple pie for the inconvenience And they still gave me cup for coffee Staff are friendly Huge play area for kids 
1,Wow this McDonald s is different First of all there s floors The first floor is essential just for dining and ordering It is very different than a normal McDonald s however Then on the second floor which you can access via stairs or elevator features a full fledged arcade and children s play area alongside some more eating areas This McDonald s is a tourist attraction in and of itself For sure worth a visit even if you just go to see it because it s pretty cool They also happen to serve McDonald s Pizza and Pasta too 
1,Best McDonald s menu and play ground area I ever seen in my life 
1,Gas station McDonald s adjoining but separate from the station s Timewise convenience store Bathrooms in between which were clean and multi stalled Staff appeared to all be wearing masks which is appreciable given their position of making food for and interacting with such a confluence of travelers from far flung corners as they must Food quality was on the high side of McDonald s very small margin of differentiation Only hic up is that the space is not built for intimate conversations and since they don t yell at you over the ambient hustle and bustle I had some difficulty hearing the teller taking our order as well as though at a near table did not hear our order number called hence I took off a star for ambiance in my rating here 
1,This was actually the fastest McDonald s I ve ever been in for the drive thru I ordered on the app go to the pay window waited about a minute and a half got my drink then my food and I m finally I was on my way I wish other McDonald s were just as fast 
1,This is the best McDonalds I ll come here for breakfast lunch and the staff is always super friendly and kind the food is always hot and they give you a cookie with your order when placed through the app Don 
1,This McDonalds stands out from the others It has great management friendly fast service and the food always taste like it should The restaurant is ALWAYS clean and its connected to a convenient store if you need to grab other things as well or need to get gas Great location that puts you right back onto the highway if you are traveling and has clean restrooms for the kids

1,Consistent and great customer service for over a year now Had to update my review as I order food here regularly I know this isn t a fancy wine and dine but I never have a bad experience regardless if using the mobile app or drive thru or the occasional walk in I do The manager and great team are to thank for this Always polite timely and much more than you get at any other McDonald s

1,This McDonald s is always in the same place and it s as good as any McDonald s ever 
1,This is honestly my favorite McDonald s my food is always fresh the staff is always nice and I even get lucky and find a free cookie in the bag from time to time 
1,Generally fast service accurate orders This particular McDonald s is attached with a gas station and is often pretty busy but the line does tend to move quickly I do often check my order to ensure I receive my order accurately for example I get the ketchup or dipping sauce I asked ordered with my meal and generally the orders are accurate The lines may take a bit more time but again this particular location is at a busy intersection and the next close McDonald s is going to be in Boerne

1,My favorite thing that I have been getting from McDonalds is the chicken biscuit meal and I add folded egg and cheese that comes with a hashbrowns and a drink which is always half sweet and half unsweet And it is the best I highly recommend it if you want a hearty meal with meat and breakfast food So I highly recommend it

1,This is the best McDonald s I have been to in a long time I have across the street from my apartment and I wish I could swap them out Service at THIS McDonald s is excellent and everyone that I interacted with was friendly and helpful The food actually looked like the advertising and tasted good I was so impressed that I asked for the manager so I could thank him and compliment his crew I truly believe that managers affect everything about their restaurant for good or bad Happy respected employees who feel properly valued always reflect that in their interactions with customers and you could see that this manager was a leader of a team and not just the boss Great McDonald s experience 
1,I would usually not rave about McDonald s as we eat there multiple times a week but the service at this location was head and shoulders above the norm Elizabeth the floor supervisor was amazing She customized our burgers and figure out the best combos to feed the family She made sure we had everything we needed and introduced us to strawberry pie Highly recommend this location 
1,I enjoyed my deluxe spicy crispy chicken sandwich 
1,This store has a lot of younger people working it But they do a really great job and are always polite 
1,I can t quit you LOL Unlike other Mc D s these guys actually check your order and make sure you have a straw Because that REALLY matters especially when you are on the road Always pleasant and accurate and FAST service here I love these guys 
1,My Chicken McGriddle was definitely a delight to my tastebuds 
1,One of the better ones around with nice employees
1,It s hot and good and lots of Big Mac sauce 
1,The lobby just opened up after having been remodeled for the past few months and it s so clean Everything is looking and smelling great The staff have gotten more accurate and faster Highly recommend Edit I forgot to mention they have those kiosks to order yourself which severely reduces waiting time An employee was even willing to show me how to use the darn thing I refused of course Edit Being the lover of caramel that I am it should come as no surprise that I m in love with the new to America stroopwafel McFlurry Highly recommend giving that a try 
1,I went through the drive through Friday Dec at about a m There was a young black female working the window where you pay and I have to say she set the tone for my day What a sweetheart she was all smiles and just a joy for my first stranger encounter of the day With the way things have been going in this country the last several months she was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary daily grind and I will not soon forget how she lifted my spirits all over a sausage burrito and a cup of coffee She set the bar good job 
1,The last person just said this place is outdated and mentioned that there are iPads on the tabe For some reason that doesn t make sense to me I just went there and ordered some food The manager who took my order joked around with me making me laugh That s always a plus After I payed I decided that I wanted an ice cream cone The manager dude that took my order just gave me the ice cream cone on the house The food I ordered was delicious too Thanks yall I ll be back for sure now 
1,Great female staff one of the older women gave me great service

1,Awesome Sevice Fresh Breakfast Sandwiches Thank You
1,As always great costumer service and excellent food quality After paying close attention to the conveyor belt I see the food is made above the restaurant I think that s pretty awesome Great costumer service as always The ladies working behind the counter are definitely doing a great job 
1,This is one of the busiest McDonald s I ve seen On the rare occasions when I come here for a coffee and hashbrown in the morning this place is always packed full of hungry antsy customers The staff are incredibly patient and hardworking McDonald s customers myself included are probably the most annoying customers in the restaurant industry but
1,I m glad to see this location is finally open again Everything in the drive thru was fast smooth and consistent with what I expect from a McDonald 
1,What a awesome staff that works here ALWAYS smiles and willing to take your order and get it right Ketsia is just a sweetheart and very attentive to anything that is needed customer service is out of this world Conrad is wonderful and he has a pleasure to talk to always 
1,The guys in the drive thru were so nice Love the deals too BOGO 
1,Food is always fresh My son loves when we head over after school for a little lunch 
1,This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to They were closed for several months due to construction The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft The best thing about McDonald s are the FRIES Their fries are always fresh hot and delicious The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures I don t mind waiting in the sometimes long drive thru line for fresh food Thank you for having pride in the food you serve 
1,I can always close my eyes and count on the flavor being the same decade after decade
1,Nice place very friendly Needs to be a little more quicker Its very small despite the tall building it was not busy either so the service shouldn t have taken so long
1,Great food and service Cleanest most organized McDonalds I have ever been in 
1,The rest room was clean I was craving French fries plus chicken nuggets and I got them they were nice and crisp
1,Best customer service we ve ever had at a McDonald s and close to if not the best service we ve had at any restaurant period Clean well managed and unexpectedly a very nice experience with our family of little kids Thanks for exceptional service 
1,The counter girl was very friendly and helpful I want to use my app and the girl helped me out I did have to wait almost minutes to get someone to take my order Thank you 
1,This McDonald s is one of the best The food is always prepared well I hate waiting in line but I never have to worry about that here Yes there are lines but the staff is fast and proficient and I always ask for my meals to be made fresh although it isn t always necessary Because of their popularity it always fresh and hot A good place to stop or pickup a good and hot fast meal 
1,I was on drive thru so it was all good
1,My friend and I ate here together and we both deem this to be the best McDonald s that we have ever been to Twice the manager came around to us to make sure that everything was going well That s a first for me at a McDonald s 
1,I had a BigMacAttack glad the sandwich was nearby this hour 
1,Clean premises Professional service Delicious food When it s less busy they ll come up to your table to check on your experience 
1,First time back since it was remodeled The girl in the drive thru was great Very friendly and personable 
1,Paid a visit to see the unique architecture Inside was small but very clean They accepted my coupon and my order was brought to my table quickly No complaints with my food but it seemed like someone was having trouble with an Uber Eats order My cashier was scolded by the manger for being too cold or rude to some co workers he kept repeating treat everyone like an equal

1,Carlos the young man running the front was so friendly and all smiles even though he was getting overran and I myself was a bit of a problem for him as I had kids who ordered minutes apart from each other and changed their order twice He still managed to take it all in stride and got us our food in a reasonable amount of time and with a smile on his face 
1,As always McDonald s prices are good for your pocketbook Bought it for my three little friends and they were very full And my wallet was very happy Very friendly employees as well 
1,Although it took longer than I expected to dine on there was actually service and concern from the attentive staff And I really like the burgers I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the bottom bun To cut carbs If you do it quickly the cheese doesn t melt so it very easy to go openfaced

1,I am so happy and glad that they finally reopen And a new remodel is amazing really nice

1,Let me just say I don t think I ve ever gone out of my way to leave a review for a fast food chain Especially not the biggest in the world It s so easy to think of these places as just another installment in a gigantic corporation but I think it s important to remember that these places are made up of the individuals who work there For that reason after coming here for a couple of years I have to say that they do a phenomenal job I only ever go through the drive thru but after being so used to no smiles miserable demeanors and a lack of basic customer service skills thank you have a nice day I need to shout out how friendly and consistent everyone at the drive thru line is here The women who take your payment are always nice and even the woman who hands out the food usually a job where you will get absolutely zero smiles is always so nice and genuine If somebody owns a business and is looking for a good customer service and people who will treat customers as expected then give people a shot based on everyday encounters like these 
1,This location was a pleasant experience and in the overnight shift no less This is in my recent experience with the fast food industry as a whole excluding chick FIL a a rare occurrence and I feel that I have to give some praise here 
1,Here you get hot food and friendly faces We go there every first Saturday of the month And always have a good time 
1,I m not a McDonald s guy but the food was hot the fries were hot and crispy my burger was hot and juicy and delicious I ll come back
1,I was pleased with this McDonald s location all around I got my food quickly the service from the speaker to the drive through window cashier was great and my order was accurate 
1,Fresh hot food All items in order were correct and served quickly to our table The cashier was polite and helpful My kids really enjoyed the updated play equipment inside their air conditioned play area ordered inside using the touch screen Picked two happy meals chose NO Toys and a spicy chicken sandwich meal Took our table tent to our table to dine in Received food shortly after Happy meals had toys one was missing its apples and I didn t get my drink Every thing was corrected without issue it would just be nice to get everything right the first time It means to me that someone wasn t paying attention when they should have been 
1,Gotta come here on the late night The two ladys at night that work till am are the best They are the most pleasant people EVERY TIME WE COME The food is better The fries are fresh Double quarter pounder fresh Rose and Mrs Shamee the manager We thank you so much

1,very nice and respectful customer service and clean bathrooms 
1,Fast food friendly staff and ok coffee 
1,Went to work this day I was pressed for time but the drive thru was very fast
1,I think the morning shift are one of if not the best they provide great customer service and good food definitely coming more to this McDonald 
1,If you like McDonalds this is s good one I like McDonalds 
1,They always have the nicest staff and the tables and bathrooms are always clean I can t figure out why people don t just accept the Golden Arches The food is good and nutritious You don t need to order a big mac every time Just get a salad 
1,The interior was something I d never seen before There were planted boards you could use to place your order before reaching the counter but the line was short so it wasn t needed The place was clean and all the orders were right It was a nice stop for a sit down quick lunch like how fast food should be 
1,I ll always come back here The food s always right and the store and bathroom is always clean Nobody bothers you I even ate pizza here and the management didn t seem to care and it s a good place to eat and work There aren t too many good McDonald s you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there One day I was low on money but really had to eat One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy It was hot as h t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat 
1,Actually an especially above average location Service and food are what should be expected Clean Restroom has hands free door opener Kids Play Place is especially nice Has modern play equipment toddler area and interactive life size video game station 
1,I can only speak to their breakfast as it s the only thing I ve purchased there Service is fast and the food is great 
1,Best McDonald s around The people who work there are always super nice the service is very good compared to other McDonald s in this area And there are NOT any of those horrible self serve kiosks Oh how I hate those things The restaurant is clean and we ll maintained This is my favorite 
1,Every once in awhile you just got to have a quarter pounder Today it was a quarter pounder with fries and a Coke So good The Quarter Pounders are made with fresh meat now and you can really taste the difference And everyone knows that McDonald s has the best Fountain Coke They tested a couple of times per hour just to ensure the formula is Right Plus they have those nice fat straws that make for big sips 
1,We did dine in But used the app to order the food and it was ready in a reasonable time We also got to enjoy the AC and sit inside and eat 
1,They made a mistake on my order but I hadn t left the parking lot yet I called them and told them and they gave me the correct sandwich right away Great service 
1,What makes this place star to me is the Manager Nikko Nikko is super friendly genuinely caring about HONEST customers and makes you wanna come back for some of his cheer Service is great here with seldom a mistake in the mornings when I come in Th
1,I ve ubered and ordered at this particular McDonald s and I ve always had a positive experience They don t ignore you and they actually get to their customers in the order that they are in Great team up there and positive work attitude 
1,Who doesn t love McDonalds fries quick service it always fast not really a long wait Mmmmmm fries 
1,Love this spot Convenient location right off of major highways food is prepared properly drive thru turns over quickly coffee is delicious No complaints This is what every McDonald s should be like 
1,Fast service hot fries fresh burgers It s McD s Somehow the food is fresher in our drive thru only world People at this one always are nice considering they need to deal with peeps like me that never know what they want It s been the same basic menu for decades LOL
1,If you don t know what you re getting into when you go to a McDonald s you re probably coloring more often than reading My Sprite tasted EXACTLY like Sprite 
1,I wouldn t normally write a review especially for a McDonalds that I go to often but recently I have been going through the drive through and have seen a man that has twice as much enthusiasm as anybody else working there I believe his name is Brandon but every time I go he always seems to brighten my day 
1,Some people still swear that McDonald s has the best coffee It s not my personal favorite but it s good and inexpensive Discounts for seniors Love the value meal selections too 
1,The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness This is one of our favorite locations to visit 
1,They were wicked fast and very friendly I had actually stopped going to any McDonalds because of bad experiences elsewhere with really dry nuggets Did not regret getting food there today 
1,I just want to say MCDonalds does NOT take phone orders also you would not believe the amount of prank calls they get a night There hasn 
1,They are doing a remodel for the lobby But the drive through was open Associate was very nice and we had a nice conversation while waiting on the food 
1,THE STAFF WAS KIND AND COURTEOUS THEY QUICKLY CORRECTED MY ORDER WHEN I RECEIVED IT WITHOUT KETCHUP OR BBQ SAUCE
1,You are sure of a good meal every time Had a great brunch there today 
1,My over year experience with McDonald s Restaurants in this area Southlake Grapevine Keller Northlake and north FW This one is by far the best one I have been eating food regularly from this Roanoke McDonald s for a little over a year now This is the only place that makes the Big Mac the way I remember it as a kid I do not post reviews often at all I am making this one because of my experiences at all of the area McDonalds If you decide to eat McDonald s go to this one 
1,That was the best quarter pounder I ve had in years for real Every once in awhile it s great I would have taken a picture but I wasn t thinking Picture perfect
1,Great neighborhood McD It s not open but has enough friendly staff to keep its drive through going while quickly serving your order if you re inside 
1,Good food friendly service and pretty quick as well
1,Iced mocha is awesome they make it just right 
1,Guys just to let you know I hate McDonald s I just keep coming back and knowing that s its killing me What I m trying to say is that im addicted and I cant stop eating I eat because I m unhappy and I m unhappy cause I eat Lol star

1,We read previous reviews and thought about changing our dining plans Glad we didn t everything was as McDonald s advertises 
1,clean bathroom and wonderful staff always helpful when it comes to confusing times and orders 
1,We had a very good experience here from the day crew Manager was super friendly staff was organized It s the very first time that I didn t have to take my burger out and place all the ingredients in it myself because it was sloppy Burgers were picture perfect Props to the cook and line for a job well done 
1,Most times I just stop in for a snack and get fries because they are always fresh and HOT 
1,Excellent service just got in to rush hour at the lunch time but it took less then minutes to get the food 
1,They always get the food out super fast and always seem to be in a good mood it s a great location the times I have not had a good time are few and far between so keep being awesome 
1,We ate here twice in a row this McDonald s is awesome from the cleanliness to t
1,Nice place to take breakfast or delicious lunch and customer service available any time you walk inside
1,We went inside this time so I could use expiring points The man who helped me was so patient and helpful with me figuring out the app Didn t act like I was putting him out either 
1,I came in having a bad day and the manager noticed that I was frustrated because everyone was busy when I walked in Long story short The manager paid for my meal with a smile Great customer service

1,In a sea of overpriced and mediocre food within the mega corporation casinos this humble McDonald s is a reasonably priced breath of fresh air Just a good ol Mickey D s with real world prices 
1,Excellent working staff Super clean dining area and kitchen Super helpful staff cant praise them enough If looking for a restroom you do Need to ask for the code and theyll let you in We were here on a Wednesday at pm 
1,Pretty good The Sprites they gave us tasted like seltzer apparently they had just ran out but they made it up to us with a different soda And their fries were hot fresh crisp salty just the way I like them Fyi there s limited parking in front facing LV Boulevard but in the back there are a lot of spaces 
1,First time using the touch screen ordering system Pretty easy Manager supervisor seemed to have an off putting attitude A smile goes a long way Food was hot and fresh and correct 
1,Food was better than most other McDonalds fries fresh hot well seasoned and mcchicken was crispy Tasted really good 
1,They charge more for the same food because it s on the strip I never understood that But the food and the service were great at the drive thru 
1,Luisa the manager is great She resolved an issue went above beyond what she was expected to do Thanks for everything 
1,These people are nice Quick service I enjoyed my time here The staff are repectful and colorful Very vibrant crew Clean and respectfully kept up to par Keep it up please This is the service you never expect but never regret Thanks Next time I come back to vegas I ll be back 
1,I am loving the comment by the guy below who comes here after mass but gets upset at the all homeless people Irony is not dead 
1,Unique Andrew had amazing customer service and my food came out fresh 
1,Boca Park McDonald s is by far the best McDonald s in the Las Vegas Valley The staff not only keeps the place spotless they truly care about the customers They let you charge your phone if you need to They have fresh flowers on some of the tables and of course a play area for children 
1,Clean environment fast and finally service I really like the decor and style of the place Cheap food in a ridiculously expensive City
1,We was on holiday and stayed in the hotel opposite called the mandalay bay hotel on a room only basis as is all USA hotels as far as I know so for breakfast I nipped across the road now that s a fun thing to do as they drive on the wrong side of the road The service was great albeit the staff was run off there feet most of the time McDonald s get a fre more staff in as they need it in this place food was as expected only one time did I get my coffee fix without any milk but it was OK
1,They only had a couple of working kiosks but you can also order at the cashier The service is fast and my food came out fresh A few of the drinks had run out but there was still a good variety 
1,The only reason I am giving a star is because the gentleman who was sweeping the floor n trying to keep the place clean was the hardest worker caring individual in the whole place Thank you n God bless
1,We visited this McDonald s around weeks ago just for drinks after visiting the welcome to Vegas sign I was surprised how clean the place was fresh flowers on the tables service was quick and friendly even though there was a queue Hot a caramel frappuccino and a strawberry milkshake both came beautifully presented Can t say a bad thing about this store keep up the good work guys 
1,Who thinks of reviewing a fast food place Well if you receive outstanding service from a teenager working hard then the establishment and all the employees deserve a star rating Not only did the employee flawlessly do his job He took the time to observe my car while in the drive thru to tell me my tire was going flat We all know that could have been disastrous had I kept going Great job 
1,So busy we had to wait minutes for our food Yet I have never seen a more efficient food production line They were serving numbers already in the s when we arrived at am Very clean courteous 
1,First time at this location The drive thru young lady was so sweet and had great communicating skills when she took my order and when she took my payment The lady at the next window who gave me my food was very friendly too Great staff At first I didn t want to got to a Mcds in the strip but I m glad I did Thank you guys 
1,McDonalds is always our go to place Your welcomed by friendly staff You know what your getting before venturing in They offer everything from standard to a healthy menu I like how they are more modern in there decor McDonalds stands behind the quality and standards of there food The only restaurant I know of that will refund or replace items 
1,Hot fresh breakfast and coffee Easy to walk to from the shout Four Seasons Mandalay and the Delano It 
1,Good Quick Lunch Spot
1,We have eaten here several times over the weekend and it s definitely the best McDonald s I ve ever been too The food was great the service was stellar Night and day shifts Highly recommend

1,We used drive thru in the late evening hours Service was time efficient food was good Fench fries were fresh and delicious It just hit the spot on that late evening as we headed to our hotel Five stars 
1,Great as always cheap and cheerful
1,I m staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel My wife my wife s friend and I got sick of paying total each meal so we decided to slum it and go to McDonald s Can t beat total that includes ice cream I think I paid for a single Margarita daiquiri poolside It was clean service was prompt and it wasn t too crowded You get what you expect at McDonald s and that s all you re asking for Cheap fast good tasting food So if you re staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and you re looking for something cheap take the minute walk and head over to McDonald s You will only feel a little guilty

1,morning mac Participated in an exhibition in the United States to promote the detoxifying effect of Yaeyama chlorella Morning Mac at McDonald s near the venue The difference from Japan is that you put your own drinks 
1,Friendly staff trying to help if you don t know much English like me The BigMc tastes like it does in Germany but the DoppelBeff is incredibly tasty and the fat drips out but you have to eat it when you re there
1,This fast food restaurant chain offers among its main products hamburgers French fries breakfast menus soft drinks milkshakes ice creams desserts and fruit salads service It is very fast and of very good quality 
1,I like it even though I know you can t always eat it But I end up here several times a year 
1,This isn t your typical McDonald s This place is located at Waikea Beach So there is a lot of foot traffic It can get very busy here There are signs all over asking you to limit your stay to minutes I ve seen the line to order going front the order window to outside the door But there are kiosks available to order from Food consistent with one expects from this chain Nice Hawaiian music playing throughout the day on their sound system 
1,Across the street from Waikiki Beach Most restaurants in the area are upscale full dining If you want a quick bite on the go this is the best option Use the mobile app or kiosk to save time Probably one of the better McD s I 
1,I went like four times in the morning in my vacation to get my coffee and Robert is a great guy always with a big smile on his face Hawaii needs more people with his same attitude The only sad part was I never was able to tried this pie 
1,Okay this is a gem in the middle of a super expensive Waikiki You can order on the screen and pay and just wait for your order to be called They have great Americanos and Iced Coffees Super great quality and cheap not for an Iced Latte like everywhere else Amazing location Crowded of course it is Waikiki what do you expect 
1,A Culinary Ode to McDonald s The Epitome of Delicious and Affordable Dining Never cease to amaze us with your consistently appetizing offerings and your unwavering commitment to providing mouthwatering meals at unbeatable prices A true beacon of fast food excellence McDonald s has reigned supreme for generations and its legendary menu items have captured the hearts and taste buds of millions around the world One of the crowning jewels of McDonald s their nuggets are nothing short of extraordinary With a golden crispy exterior and tender juicy interior these delectable nuggets are the epitome of culinary perfection They are seasoned to perfection giving each bite a harmonious blend of savory and flavorful goodness It s no wonder that these little bites of heaven have become a staple in fast food history And let us not forget the pi ce de r sistance that is the Quarter Pounder ld s dedication to providing affordable high quality dining experiences for all Each bite of the Quarter Pounder boasts a succulent juicy patty cooked to perfection smothered in a tantalizing blend of cheese and crispy bacon The mouthwatering aroma alone is enough to send my senses into overdrive Paired with a generous serving of their world famous fries and a refreshing beverage the Quarter Pounder with Cheese Bacon meal is a steal at just It s no exaggeration to say that McDonald s is making a significant charitable contribution to society by providing these scrumptious meals at such affordable prices They are not just satisfying our hunger but also nourishing our souls with the joy and comfort that only their delicious food can bring So to McDonald s we raise our glasses and our nuggets in praise and admiration Thank you for your unwavering dedication to quality affordabilitynd the countless memories you ve helped create around shared meals and moments of pure palate pleasing bliss 
1,We had breakfast here one morning It s really busy but they did a great job getting our food out quickly Food was hot and tasted good 
1,Fast cheap and close to the beach Cheapest food available that we could see If your looking for inexpensive food with no waiting times this is it 
1,Hawaiian breakfast from McDonalds Very tasty and economical We ate breakfast there one day just to save a little while on vacation 
1,Cheap and very convenient for beach goers The rice breakfast is very good if you are super hungry
1,Maybe the fastest McDonald s I 
1,Service is fantastic They do a really good job serving soft serve cone ice cream And for some reason it s cheape
1,The workers were so helpful to me I had a very special need and they worked together to help me individually These workers are awesome 
1,I love the McDonalds app it s really good you just have to be close to check in so
1,Service was overall good and staff was friendly I liked that this location had a touch of Hawaii to it compared to the typical ones you would see on the main land 
1,Very busy but tables were cleaned quickly and table service was quick sausage and egg muffin was perfect and hash brown was crispy probably the best I ve ever had Not a great coffee selection but my fresh coffee with cream was good Also its probably the cheapest breakfast for a few miles around here 
1,It was very different but we were ready for some fast food because we had been eating the food on the ship but what I found really odd is this place had no bathrooms I was thinking because they are so close to the beach just very strange
1,Wish every McDonald s had this breakfast the deluxe combo with rice hits the spot I recommend the haupia pies as well They also do Hawaiian coffee Wish they served this all day 
1,Try their Spam eggs rice Don t get that in Houston Texas 
1,I know its a fast food restaurant but i was happy with the visit One of the fastest McDonald s I have ever been to Great service with hot fries and good burgers An excellent across the beach location 
1,When you need that late night wait no That wee hours of the morning everything is closed cure our go to place They did a great job of clearing the homeless Seen this place transform still quaint but better than nowhere to go when everything is closed 
1,Maccas hawaii it is what it is homeless guy was given left overs from from some random guy who ate at another restaurant Got crispy chicken burger was good Mahalo
1,This McDonald s is across the street from Waikiki Beach Don t forget to try the Hawaii only meals with Spam rice and eggs Prices are slightly higher than other McDonald s but A LOT cheaper than surrounding restaurants Enjoy 
1,Great location to get a cup of coffee to kick start early in the day
1,A plus this year a security staff member in place Neater cleaner more efficient 
1,The people were so friendly and inviting there especially the other customers The workers were great considering that they worked under such stressful conditions star restaurant great price for dinner and a show Totally recommend The other customers have to have been the most friendly people that I have ever met I saw this girl crying tears of joy at the table next to us So heartwarming 
1,I would give stars only for the coffee and soft serve they sell I have had a better experience with McDonald s customer service product quality and menu variety wise out of U S vs within the U S U S market definitely needs improvement 
1,So many tourists and residents This place has awesome employees We used app and we didn t wait too long Clean 
1,The food was delicious I tried the spam egg and rice meal it was so good The service was great 
1,Killer an affordable place to get your grub on you need to get the local brkfest 
1,Right in front of Waikiki Beach 
1,Busy but good the staff was getting the orders out quickly Had a small issue but they fixed it without even asking 
1,Its hit or miss at this location some time the staff is friendly and sometimes they arent so friendly but I can understand it is a high traffic area because of tourist but we are all human We get burnt out The app is great by the way 
1,The million dollar sunset views from the patio are phenomenal 
1,The food was hot and just as I ordered it Remember they are busy I used the app to order me and my wife s breakfast It took about minutes Remember to thank the workers for working They could probably make more money with unemployment benefi
1,Fast service and we ate something different 
1,Quick service even though it s packed Tastes like McDonald s with a nice view 
1,Fast service and a great option after the beach 
1,Situated right in front of the Kuhio beach at a street corner with inside and outside tables it is a good place to order your morning breakfast at a quality you know and a price you like from McDonald 
1,It s the only place open early morning We all know Mcd s 
1,Cheap and cheerful and with a good view In expensive places like this I m grateful for McDonald s keeping it simple 
1,Usually fast service and accurate on my orders Very busy and long line from am am On the mountain side of The street strip on Waikiki Beach so it 
1,A visitor from Australia and McDonald s worker it was amazing service was quick the restaurant was clean the food quality was great I will be coming back before I go home
1,Had breakfast here twice while staying close by Very busy location but got through pretty quickly considering the volume of people Order was correct hot and fresh Nothing to complain about here 
1,My Husband had to eat at the McDonald s in Honolulu he was happy to see they had one and the price was right and the service was great 
1,Nice and clean You can see Pacific Ocean and banyan tree over the window It s awesome experience They serve white rice on Big breakfast I never expected New kiosk for fast order Overall wonderful place Oh I forgot They has pineapple pie instead of apple pie It s so good too 
1,This time of the night was actually a lot better as far as service wise how long it took us to get our food It wasn t busy at all the touch screen kiosk thing really does help out a lot to be honest because the lines inside of any McDonald s can get real hectic cause long lines end up with a bunch of irritated customers 
1,I went to McDonald s at AM and ordered my food online When I got there I waited about minutes I believe So I walked up to the cashier and asked about my food and noticed my number still didn t come up I was shocked to find out that their computer was down and my order was not there so they made my order right away even though there was a line of people at least long I go there quite often and they remember me I felt so blessed and thankful that they treated me so well even
1,We used the touchscreen order board and circumvented the line Our food was brought to us fairly quickly I really enjoyed my scrambled eggs rice and Portuguese sausage Coffee was great as usual My wife really liked her order that included Spam We sat outside and watched the people walk by and gazed over at Waikiki beach Highly recommended 
1,I usually avoid McDonalds like the plague but I d be lying if I said I didn t make an acceptation with this one I only ever got coffee but it was not bad I m typically quite picky but for a dollar I got a few during my stay I enjoyed the interesting people that would come in through out the day and also the less fortunate in the late hours Good conversations and the staff where pretty chill about the homeless most nights They are people too We only got kicked out one night but there was many of us just sleeping to be fair I appreciated the genuine staff 
1,Most beautiful McDonald in the world 
1,So good so fast but no bathroom
1,this was great but however the workers did not approve of my orange hair and constantley called me ranga sophie allem
1,New chicken sandwiches are tasty and priced reasonably Only recommendation is some kind of sauce or mayo be added to this sandwich Kind of bland and dry The spicy chicken sandwich is too hot and also should have mayo added 
1,This McDonald s location can get pretty busy Some of the meal and specific item prices are higher than other locations but that s to be expected Service is good and fast Good spot to grab an ice cream cone on a hot day

1,Quick meal Waikiki Across the street from beach Outside seating incredible view
1,Had an interview with the manager Barbra the experience was phenomenal from the moment I walked in the atmosphere of the room was very light and forgiving With tourist busily and undecidedly wandering about and workers happily and busily taking orders and cleaning common areas I learned a lot about McDonald s as a company They have so many opportunities for their employees I was truly blown away By how amazing it could potentially be for me to work under a fast food restaurant that gets so much backlash from media and my own friends Five stars for me 
1,The SPAM and rice at this McDonald s are fantastic Recommend avoiding the portuguese sausage I also really loved the pineapple pies deep fried not baked when they were available for a limited time The new buttermilk tenders are great and I love their honey mustard Why can t Canada have nice things

1,The line was quick and dine in was open You have to wait to be seated so they can clean the tables because of COVID

1,Think McDonald s on the beach They do offer local specials like spam eggs and rice Very efficient operation Lots of people but the line moves very fast Must have great management

1,I needed a quick meal will on break at the Gaylord Palm business convention Pros any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land They keep the same consistent taste world wide as a business owner this is admirable This location was efficient and fast Cons we all know it s not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location So I only ate it once on my day stay McDonald s should explore healthier options for the current market But still a great experience out of Stars 
1,Always clean and super fast ordering on the app
1,First time I had been to a McDonald s in America It s certainly nothing special but there isn t anything wrong with the location Food was fine and it was cool to try the different items from the menu Also yes french fries taste the same whether you buy them from the UK or America 
1,I will admit this was a first at this location as it is always so busy when I arrived there was a line almost out to the street and this is a double drive through was worried I would be there a while but only took about ten mins as they moved quick and to my surprise my fries were fresh and hot Best fries I have had in a while Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky But all was right on this last time Good cheez burg

1,This McDonald s was excellent the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald s I have been to It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant no matter where I go in America so far there is a better than chance that the coffee for example will be the same thing I am use to and desire 
1,The workers are pleasant and the food here is always hot and good 
1,Quick service accurate follow up
1,They had a broken latte machine The kiosk already had our CC deposit It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business and the restaurant was overly crowded They used to make great cappuccinos but it got to be too loud and those machines broke more frequently than lattes

1,We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team What an experience There s a lot of different food options including PIZZA The place is amazing If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place Unbelievable 
1,Great Mcdonalds Really love the clean store the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders Highly recommend this store if you re in the area The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive the road is pretty interesting at times In conclusion I rate this McDonald s and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs

1,Hello everyone First I have to say that I have not been to McDonald s in forever With that being said I went through the drive thru because I didn t want to get out The young man who took my order was kind that was the first window nd window a whole other story Drive up and right off the bat this young lady looks mad that she is even working You know at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job I was scared to ask her for a cup holder but I did any way lol I had the BigMac Meal and remember like I said I had not been in forever I DEVOURED THAT BIG MAC it Was fresh and so were the fries I also had a Fish sandwich So yes I recommend 
1,Excellent customer service fresh food and juice Recommend 
1,We went drive through this location and had a good experience 
1,Great experience The food was great but the real experience was the customer service Destiny was super helpful and even overheard us talking about asking for extra syrup for the pancakes and went and got it for us without us even having to ask Customer service sometimes seems like a thing of the past but not at this McDonald s Also when I spoke to the manager about the great experience he was very nice as well Great McDonald s All McDonald s should be modeled after this one Thank you guys

1,Celebrating my daughter s th birthday by nearby hotel Lunch was perfect with the game room pla
1,Our little one was having a pretty rough morning and Ms Maria stepped in and went above and beyond to try to make her happy Margot ended up smiling and dancing and even ended up passing out a few high fives Ms Maria made all of our days better Thank you for bringing a smile to our faces The location service was prompt our order from the kiosk was accurate and the food was well prepared Clean location and restrooms at am on a Thursday 
1,Had a pleasant trip here with my year old On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonald s there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean food was fresh tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually don t freeze there s like back at home Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom doing paperwork five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home 
1,My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table I noticed I didn t have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn t on the tray either I let her know and she apologized then comes back with not one but hash browns which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now She comped a free hashbrown She was such a pleasant person to deal with Her customer service and customer care abilities are I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn t her usual location and she is a General Manager She took care of evryone around us with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face which is a rare occasion I hope she gets the recognition she deserves and a promotion or raise She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one It s funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up 
1,Love their new chicken tenders it s about time McD s start picking up their game 
1,We only went through the drive through 
1,The employees were very nice 
1,Good service tucked away
1,Visiting from out of town I was very impressed with the manager Stephanie She really stood out to me today because she was working very hard and every customer that came her way she made sure she assisted them with out rushing them even though they were very busy She also took the time to pick up in lobby to keep the inside looking good Thanks for that experience today Step 
1,Always call here after visiting Seaworld It s half the price of the food in Seaworld We order on the App before we leave and it is brought to our vehicle minutes after we arrive nice and hot My orders have been accurate since using the App vs the drive through 
1,Breana on the amusements kiosk has made our evening giving her time to explain loading the amusement cards up really kind and helpful and nothing was rushed or too much trouble my children really loved her and all the way home said how nice she was We ve had bad experiences in this mcdonalds long waits for happy meals etc but i think she easily changed those for us today I hope she gets recognised for how good she s been 
1,This place is amazing clean place nice employees and they have updated there technology I 
1,Wow it 
1,Some of the negative reviews I m seeing might be for other I Drive locations This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good It s a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando 
1,Updated review This really is a great McDonald s Maybe if you don t appreciate it you haven t been around The grounds are clean I saw the manager Chris picking up trash around the store They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya ll It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby I think service is pretty fast Review I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot place clean and staff prompt and courteous Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning 
1,It s a busy McDonald s in the morning based on its location however their service is good and fast Great place to dine in 
1,Order was accurate and tasted great Fast service They were out of some items so had to change our order slightly 
1,The manager here always is very accommodating and always makes sure that the place is clean 
1,Love this place
1,Very modern McDonald s plenty of self service kiosks drive through is efficient and they even have a patio so you can eat outside They also have table service Place was very clean too and the soda machine had dozens and dozens of combinations 
1,They where A they where closing still let us come in served us all it was a lot of us served us like we where they st customers alllll food was hot 
1,Visited a few days after Christmas it was a quick walk from our hotel Considering the amount of people that were ordering our food came out quick They forgot some items and they were very apologetic and got the rest of our order right away 
1,Fries and nuggets were hot and fresh I got the family share about nuggets nuggets and large fries Plus the off with mobile app Great deal 
1,We had breakfast this morning and was greeted by a manager in a suit who helped us place our order on the kiosk Our hot fresh food was brought to our table by a friendly associate While we ate I couldn t help but notice a manager holding doors for customers and assisting where needed even window washing A male associate asked if he could take our tray when we were finished The staff is impressive and the remodel looks refreshing
1,McDonald s is my favorite restaurant of all My dad or mom always order something we like Mine is the double cheeseburger with no pickles In Saturdays and mostly Fridays we get those burgers for dinner Like to see McDonald s keeping up the good work 
1,Best McDonalds in the area Great coffee modern decor clean Wifi Quickest service Friendly and helpfull staff

1,The nicest workers I have ever met The main lady I didn t catch her name but she was so friendly and helped my family order on their touch screens and she was so nice and helpful It is refreshing to meet someon
1,Had a slight issue ordering Inform the manager that they re ordering system was not working right They jumped on it right away to correct the problem with getting it involved Super clean and friendly store 
1,Very nice clean establishment The staff was efficient and worked diligently to provide for our every need My family and I are visiting from out of town We noticed that the employees even the store manager walked throughout the restaurant checking on customers making sure they are enjoying their food I greatly appreciate the atmosphere they provide for their customers 
1,The staff here were amazing so kind to my two children Everyone we encountered was friendly and went out of their way to help 
1,Very clean Inside and out I order on my app and the food was waiting as I walked in Everything was hot and fresh 
1,Good fast location They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car It was super convenient and it did seem to save time We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over You can t really go wrong with cheeseburgers 
1,It is very clean inside great staff I always go inside and order take out They do everything super fast 
1,The cleanest nicest McDonald s ever The staff are so welcoming and helpful and great with the kids after a long tired day Thank you 
1,We re here the other night about a m they re very kind and considerate the fries were a little late so they offered me an extra set plus the ones that were not bad in my opinion but may have been a minute older so thanks to them and their service and tasty food
1,Nothing bad to say here We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order It also seems to give you a little more time to order The place was very clean and modern in design We didn t interact too much with staff but the little we did they seemed very nice and helpful Although not used this time by us I did notice a cart specifically for sauces seasonings etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience 
1,Very nice staff good place to get all your fast food needs Tha k you 
1,They have better food than the regular McDonald s because it s the largest in the u s 
1,I love that you could touch screen order it was easy and there are people constantly cleaning I love that they bring the food to the table as well Very nice wish I had one where I love I think more people would enjoy dining in at McDonald s now 
1,I never thought I would rate a McDonald s as stars but I did Food was typical of a McDonald s but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant They smiled checked up on us cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations 
1,This place was freaking unbelievable It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins The food was good I had the broccoli and Alfredo I do recommend it The large fish tank in the middle of the floor
1,Really nice place Best McDonalds I ve ever seen Milkshake was good too 
1, am walked up to the drive through the best nightshift crew and McD 
1,Fires were pie pan hot and the chicken sangwich was pretty deece Better than usual 
1,I have visited multiple McDonalds and I have never received a great customer service like in this location by the management Great customer service great attention very respectfully They even walk bu your table to ask if everything was ok 
1,After travel around the world this is one of the best McDonald s The Manager is super kind and has the best customer service ever 
1,I realize it s fast food but I like it and go there times per month I always get a chicken sandwich meal I get a large drink and total comes to about bucks Maybe a little high but the sandwich makes it worth it International Drive location in Myrtle Beach SC 
1,Took me and my husband and kids there They loved the playground that was located upstairs It was very Spacey But just one problem was it not clean Tables dirty and staff very unfriendly But will visit again Here s pictures of the at home aftermath Wired
1,This has got to be the most improved McDonald s in the area While the others are slowly deteriorating this one maintains its beauty Everybody is always working hard and the inside is so clean If it takes long that just means they 
1,This location gets super busy but the staff seems to take it all in stride They are all very nice and polite I had a good experinece here and would go back even though they forgot the pickles on my cheeseburger That makes the McDonalds Cheeseburger 
1,Although McDonald s chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery however this outlet is different They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers Moreover they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment 
1,Super friendly place Yvette was our CSR today and she was very friendly and helpful Really clean too which is surprising because it s been raining for hours Great location too

1,Good food Good service 
1,I love this McDonald s It s across from Hilton Orlando They got good deals for breakfast and during the day The quality is amazing Way beyond what I expected The McCafe drinks were so good not water down like those in NYC I am giving this place stars if you want cheap meals that fill you up 
1,Best Mcdonalds in FL yet Quick story I came to order a quick meal because I missed a bus Almost fell out and no one engaged me about it Understandable So I ordered a meal as well because it was well maintained inside out Looking for a good restaurant This location knows hospitality Lol
1,It s McDonald s doesn t matter the city the food is all the same double cheeseburgers and a fry Perfect lunch on the go 
1,The McDonald s experience is that you can find the same on every single establishment but what really makes a difference and makes you come back is the way the employees treat the customers on this specific McDonals the manager Timothy makes such a good j
1,We went for breakfast before going to Aquatica The service was fast and good Everyone was nice and helpful and our food came out fast and hot Everything you want when you come here

1,Never ever had service like this in a maccies Don t know if it was had a convention on next door but was outstanding 
1,So I never thought I would be reviewing a McDonald s because well its McDonalds However I was in town for a conference and grabbed a quick lunch in between sessions The food was typical McDs but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one Greeted as I walked in ordered from kiosks food delivered to me staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all Cheers 
1,Clean roomy and just a wonderful eatery The food was good and the staff was great I usually dont eat at McDonalds due to the ones around my house being rather run down looking and dirty This was a pleasant surprise 
1,Good food

1,You got to love the people who work at the McDonald s across from the convention center those people can get slammed at times and unbelievable Manner and they still handle their composure thank you for all your hard work
1,It s a fairly new McDonalds I like the comfortable padded chairs for the person tables if you eat in Of course all the great hot food and serve yourself free refills of drink A great choice for a quick lunch 
1,Found it unwelcoming that food has to be paid at kiosk and no option for human interaction 
1,Clean modern and efficient service Right next door to the hotel we stayed in so great for breakfast One of the less touristy ones on I Drive and imo one of the best 
1,They always seem pleasant When I use the drive up window they are really fast waiting on us 
1,Love the electronic ordering and the table service It s nice to see that McDonald s is moving in that direction I had a much better experience because of these amenities 
1,Great food very clean received food quickly staff was friendly to me I saw staff engaged with customers and diligently cleaning their location 
1,I love the place Plenty of food choices and the place is huge 
1,I love the cashier and the people working there there was this guy named Jose which helped me in the register and also threw my food away so I barely needed to do work and it was a great experience for my family next time we visit Orlando I will visit come again
1,Good food
1,Clean Up to date technology where shoppers can order from monitor Associates were friendly and helpful Good stop between meetings 
1,I guess this has an extra added experience of a play area and and arcade to boost But Micky Ds is always somewhere you know you can go anywhere in the world and find something you like this one was slightly different as you could get pasta and pizza and all day breakfast option

1,Love it very quick service very help people
1,Regular McDonald s but the point that you ban get pizza an pasta made it a bit more interesting
1,Everything was cooked perfectly and the Service was very good We enjoyed our breakfast 
1,Im pretty sure that this is still the largest McDonald s in the world Three stories and a menu that rivals many other restaurants Large selection of desrts and other foods as well Its more like a theme restaurant Pizza and pasta plus so much more with a McDonald s theme and of course the normal Mickey D s menu is included 
1,Very clean MacDonalds Great grew However MacDonalds needs to make french fries like they use to They ve lost their loving feeling on quality 
1,Fast fresh great service 
1,Bad customer service and nasty attitude got my order wrong and didnt want to gove my money back and cheated me out of my money

1,ITS MCDONALDS Average at best but still pretty good for fast food CHILL WORKERS 
1,only mcdanks around here that gets ur order right gives you plentiful sauces and never gives u half a large fry always filled to the top we like that
1,When I was a little kid McDonald s cheeseburgers were my comfort food Grandma used to take me on play dates At some point in time the burgers weren t so great anymore Recently they started using better hamburger and it s like the good old days Except now they carry your food out to you instead of waiting on the counter 
1,I ve frequented this McDonalds at least once a week for the last year In times past I was fairly ambivalent to it It was just a place that I would go to get a quick bite to eat while I rushed off to some appointment or event But over the past few months it has become so much more to me I know the pleather seats like the back of my hand I know the nuances of the quick order kiosks I chuckle every time I see that little piece of gum stuck on the side of the drive thru wall I know when the fries are being made fresh I know and love that greasy sheen on the floor It is comfortable it is safe it is home 
1,Consistent deliciousness Slap that egg on the table and touch your toes Leave some grease on the table so the next person knows Dont mistake me for a fast food slouch I eat my mcdonalds on the couch
1,This McDonalds is amazing it has touch screens to order your self and customize your order any way you want more tartar sauce yes please with option to pay at that kiosk or at the cashier It has a hi top bar with sits maybe each one with a power outlet with USB ports to charge on the fly Is well lit nicely decorated and the staff is friendly

1,This location is near the city Zoo It is beautifully themed with majestic animals We enjoyed that they made the interior a learning environment The service was good too which was very refreshing This location features a play area as well Our orders were correct That is miraculous considering the multiple errors we normally see when placing fast food orders We felt welcomed 
1,Since it re opened I go for breakfast about once a week Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonald s anywhere in the country its so perfectly crispy every time My order has always been correct The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long 
1,We had a small birthday party for my year old at the play place and they were more than accomadating The area was clean and a worker came and helped us clean up after the fact without prompting Super nice of them 
1,Loved this place kids area was great it was nice and cold inside great after a hot day at the zoo and food was ready fast even with our big order
1,Hey yo got that buy one get one for a buck My piece nuggets almost gone Bru Taking this Big Mac for a buck home Bru hahahahaha Psi chopathicpeppamintpimpin
1,Fantastic theme which is inspired by Dallas zoo and compliments the same Spacious and also have a great kids play area Crew are good must visit when visiting the near by zoo Kids will love it A refreshing unique look than other mc Donald 
1,I think I ve always loved McDonald s and I really like what they have with the vanilla milkshake and I get to Becky McDonald s and sometimes in order of tater tots real good place real good food
1,The man that takes the order is great he been there for years He s great 
1,I went inside with my kids and being that it s next to the zoo the inside decor is made to look like we re at the zoo My kids loved sitting at the table while we waited for our food The employees were friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time The restrooms were clean as well I recommend it 
1,It s a McDonald s with a Zoo twist If you are reading this review you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside More importantly though is how efficient this location is Every time I ve been through I ve seen a drive through cars deep and watched them churn through everyone s orders in a matter of minutes If only every drive through was this efficient 
1,I am changing my review from star to stars after my recent two visits Mar This McDonald s has gone through a major overhaul Newly remodeled inside and out including employees Employees are very polite and welcoming even asked how my day was going and talked about the weather 
1,McDonald 
1,They had my food very fresh
1,The young man wearing the black mask that said king on it taking orders today during lunch was absolutely awesome His Customer service was on point and he was extremely pleasant The food was correct all across the board and we couldnt have left any happier He needs some sort of recognition for an awesome job well done He made the rest of the store look good today 
1,The employees staff were friendly and polite 
1,I didn t eat here but stopped to use the restroom on the way to DFW It seemed clean overall I enjoyed the jungle theme It was inmersive right down to Lions and Lionesses on the bathroom doors Somewhat of a weird location just off the freeway exit lots of construction in the area when we stopped by 
1,Was blown away fast and fresh food was little bummed they took animals out
1,The service was good The young girl assisting me was polite Their playground is huge and air conditioned And its decorated nicely We liked the tables with animals on them My kids have been begging to come in here They loved it 
1,Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous Great Dine in was not available yet I am looking forward to seeing the inside Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo 
1,They actually have a play area which most McDonald s don t anymore We also loved the animals inside and outside
1,New staff provide a fresh experience The food is always fresh and in it s proportioned correctness A large french fry will have more fries than a medium size Imagine that I am loving it 
1,Friendly management and staff Ready to make sure you are satisfied with your order 
1,Cute place to bring the kids Never seen a McDonalds like this one
1,The employees were very friendly Our order was correct The food was hot and fresh The tables were clean My kids were happy Thanks for a great lunch

1,I buy my drinks there The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile even the homeless Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on Robert B Cullom in South dallas and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me Since I haven t heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald s

1,Being that it s the first Mickey D s after you cross into the US from Qu bec Canada this place gets seriously packed at times with the Canadian tourists I saw buses stopping in to feed their passengers during my short visit here on top of the regular customers and or those that are traveling by cars Just like those working at Mickey D s over the border in the Canadian side mainly showing French these workers only spoke English and weren t too thrilled about French only customers I used the app to place my order which was more convenient and the workers seemed to appreciate that more since they don t have to deal with extra people face to face My order came out in timely manner even with tons of tourists flooding in and the food was good Staff was friendly as they get Huge parki
1,Great stop after coming over the border Truck parking and green grass for the dogs Always clean inside and order is always correct 
1,Nice place to stop when crossing over to the US The service is pretty fast thnaks to the help of automated service screens The restaurant is clean You can also access two drive through lanes There is a huge parking so there is always place to park The restaurant offers free wi fi which is very convenient 
1,Fresh and good Plus very clean and modern Probably the nicest McDonald s I ve been to in a while 
1,Honestly best customer service from Naisha thank you 
1,There s nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier The prices are good as always I highly recommend the dollar menu in this case Mc chickens for only The taste is very good For the price of course And the spicy one tastes even better Service was very fast but it can get very packed in the afternoon Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well it gets packed too Pickup available The everyday McDonald s but placed in a crowded and convenient spot We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce 
1,Always clean place nice flow every time I 
1,Good place Can get crowded sometimes but the service is quick I had a huge order and was served in under minutes I love McDonald s quality so much This particular location is also right down the street from Santa Monica Pier A great place to eat before going to the beach 
1,Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonald s it able to handle the busy times In my opinion consider the customer traffic however they waist no time getting orders if you do not have a cloud following then you should get what you want Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time I see they want you to enjoy your meal in my opinion In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time I was satisfied 
1,Your service was excellent the employee Erica needs a raise because when I got there the lines were long and she cleared them out real fast thank you Erica
1,Nice place even with the homeless around it s clean and comfortable place The food preparation process is fast and the staff are nice I had tried the first tim
1,No drive thru enough parking Crowded but fairly quick They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving not stuffy Mask optional at the time July All employees were wearing masks All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job Bathrooms and tables clean Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic Indoor and outdoor tables Whenever someone got up a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table In person you can order at cashiers or use one of the self service screens I believe you could also order through the app There s a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad Didn t have to wait very long for my food Less than minutes

1,One of the Best McDonald s so far Good service
1,Good location very big place
1,Doing their best for no man and the food is still the same level of addicting No drive thru and right next to the beach It is usually teeming with people and it is usually a little busy Kiosks available On this trip the payment option for me was unavailable on the kiosk 
1,Loved our family afternoon there
1,Basically what you want from McDonalds without all the bums and beggars in the store during the day
1,Friendly staff and fast service
1,High traffic fast food restaurant that doesnt fail on being exactly just that In the process however it also us one of the few places in the area that offers a no frills area to eat your food AL FRESCO And in this day in age thats priceless 
1,So busy Staff are literal heroes 
1,If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives it is very difficult to be happy Lord refresh my spirit help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest Lord You are my peace my assurance and the love that I hold on to Reach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more Lord I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love Be patient with others but mostly be patient with yourself Lord help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfections Desiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute That s happiness God gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others Lord let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate Use Jesus as your example on how to live Lord You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future Give us wisdom in our choices Dear Lord thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain You don t want to see us suffer You know the suffering that we face and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end In the midst Lord I believe that you are sufficient I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness In Jesus s name amen
1,There was a psycho there but the guard tazed her
1,Wonderful beachside McDonald s on Santa Monica Beach food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until p m 
1,We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them 
1,Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here 
1,One of the nicest mc donalds
1,They got the best breakfast here 
1,The service the is great They do a awesome job with the food and it has security there so you don t have to worry to lose your chicken nuggets and hamburger also your money 
1,Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating
1,Gets very very busy but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through By far the cheapest food place in that area so ideal if you re just visiting It s still McDonalds though so don t expect anything different from every other franchise 
1,Only place that is open late night in Santa Monica after pm Service great and you know the product Very safe and family friendly Great location
1,This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier Inside is nice They will also bring food to you that you won t see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonald s only a few times in my entire life 
1,Hot and fresh I always get the Quarter Pounder with cheese mac sauce pickles and shredded lettuce only It s the best You gotta try it Kia D WeTalkRadio com
1,First thing that caught my eye was its employees within the times I ve stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark Reason being is do to it s great customer service I understand most McDonald s now have self service available to its customers but the times that I ve gone to the beach in Santa Monica it s always been alot easier to be attended by their kind employees 
1,Right in front of the WORLD FAMOUS Santa Monica Beach Pier 
1,One of the oldest piers in the country and one of the Top places to visit while in LALALand
1,It was nice compared to how it was before quick if you use the machines to order your food You can pay credit or cash at the counter or the machine order was quick food was dope no issue 
1,Fresh Air an clean facility
1,I got my food at around PM on a Thursday night The McDonalds was packed with people yet I only had to wait a few minutes to get my food The staff was friendly and my food was made really well 
1,First the restroom was clean and it wasn t guarded with a keypad When I see that I ll go elsewhere I never use a restroom without purchase and I never ask Even the chicken sandwich was fresh Thanks for the service
1,I ate there during a week while I stayed at Santa Monica the service was really fast even when the place was crowded The computer ordering system is really effective they have modules and they help a lot for taking orders faster 
1,It s fairly crowded but got my iced macchiato and apple pie The staff were friendly and attentive for the short interaction 
1,Blessya all let s all get along McDonald is giving back Teenager do have a place to stay it hard on them Let s live and love Homeless is trying doing it staying clean Amen Grace keep it moving smile Sister Ms Rose PEACE
1,Joshua is cool and helpful Went above and beyond Good vibes and energy Happy guy and honest about the products Dude was cleaning the whole time and helping customer at same time 
1,The terror of the men was palpable in the air The stench of blood and bodily waste clung heavy It had been three days and four nights of terror Ever since the men had come to this island it seemed like everything had gone wrong Not just like God had abandoned them but had an active hand against them The coke here is always watered down 
1,Great customer service for such a busy location Eating area is kept clean throughout despite obvious challenges of a beach location
1,Always long lines use the app makes ordering much faster
1,Fast service But if you want straws you have to ask for them in Santa Monica They give you a paper straw so if you have a resusable straw i recomend bringing one Self service systems are installed to reduce waiting time 
1,Experienced placing my order by computer touch screen paying right there and shortly thereafter hearing my number called Nice clean super busy place 
1,Always very quick and helpful
1,Nice place to dine in outside obviously and take out is fast Just wish it had a driver thru overall fast service 
1,Great place for inexpensive food right at Santa Monica Pier There is also a public parking just below this place But just inquire about the price first We were charged for parking and there were cheaper options available nearby 
1,Haven t been here in a while they have remodeled They have self order and cashier order It s close to the peir so expect your occasional homeless ppl but there is a security guard 
1,Always for my husbands coffe we stip buy Value for money for a senior coffee 
1,Wonderful customer service
1,Big Mac
1,Everything was everything as usual Keep up the good work Thanks to McDonald s for a happy meal 
1,Great experience Food was great the ice cream machine was working You can take the elevator or the stairs upstairs for the arcade fun Also side note I did lost my phone while here and the employee was so great I wish I had her name but she made finding my phone a priority Me and my family will be returning here again next time we 
1,Love the world s largest McDonald s Has a kids Play Place fun arcade upstairs elevator can order pizza and many other cool menu items Although usually busy service is on pace Got my meal in about minutes I love this location Found parking in about minutes 
1,The World largest McDonald s is a must to visit if you have kids Besides the typical menu items you can order pasta and pizza customized to order The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty Only downside is the wait for the food about minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it Of course the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from The place was packed when we visited Overall a good experience 
1,Hands down best McDonald s ever We loved the game room The prices were so reasonable was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted They restaurant was clean the food was fresh and staff was friendly It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant 
1,Wow Every McDonald s should be like this place in my opinion They have arcade games and a playground all in the second floor Kids love it here we easy spend about hours playing and eating and playing again All food orders are made using the kiosks on the first floor and you take a number and find yourself a table Your order will be brought to yo
1,We couldn t wait to visit The atmosphere is a little hectic but the food is amazing Definitely not food you would eat at your hometown McDonalds Highly recommend the pesto pasta and chocolate peanut butter cake Don t forget to visit the arcade and play center upstairs Watch your child s face light up when you pull into the parking lot Highly recommend
1,If you love McDonald s this is the place to go They say it s the world s largest McDonald s The menu is definitely a bit different with pizza pasta and waffles as options There was even an arcade upstairs and a elevator to get up The sign says the restaurant is open which is nice when leaving the amusement parks 
1,We had the best time visiting the Largest McDonald s in the World This place is GREAT A must see if you re in the area I had the pizza and it was fantastic Next time I ll try the pasta Staff was super friendly helpful as well 
1,Great experience We came here on a recent trip to Orlando They have a large selection of foods They also serve pizza and pasta There is a large bakery selection On the second floor you can dine at one of the many tables or play in the large arcade There is a large kids play area but that is currently closed due to COVID 
1,The food was good The soda was a little weak but that s not what I go there for anyway Fast service Very efficient The arcade staff could be a little friendlier But overall we had a great experience 
1,Came in on a Thursday night after a Magic game around pm for the first time It was crowded with adults and children The ordering lines were long and playground was full Seeing a few people with luggage and felt this could be there first or last meal in Orlando This is the biggest McDonald s in the world and the menus are different too with pizza and pasta We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good 
1,Fantastic restaurant You must visit when in Orlando The service was good The wait time for the premium menu items was reasonable It was very clean and the staff was exceptional

1,Food is always fresh My son loves when we head over after school for a little lunch 
1,This is one of the busiest McDonald s I ve seen On the rare occasions when I come here for a coffee and hashbrown in the morning this place is always packed full of hungry antsy customers The staff are incredibly patient and hardworking McDonald s customers myself included are probably the most annoying customers in the restaurant industry but
1,This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to They were closed for several months due to construction The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft The best thing about McDonald s are the FRIES Their fries are always fresh hot and delicious The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures I don t mind waiting in the sometimes long drive thru line for fresh food Thank you for having pride in the food you serve 
1,I can always close my eyes and count on the flavor being the same decade after decade
1,Nice place very friendly Needs to be a little more quicker Its very small despite the tall building it was not busy either so the service shouldn t have taken so long
1,Great food and service Cleanest most organized McDonalds I have ever been in 
1,The rest room was clean I was craving French fries plus chicken nuggets and I got them they were nice and crisp
1,Best customer service we ve ever had at a McDonald s and close to if not the best service we ve had at any restaurant period Clean well managed and unexpectedly a very nice experience with our family of little kids Thanks for exceptional service 
1,The counter girl was very friendly and helpful I want to use my app and the girl helped me out I did have to wait almost minutes to get someone to take my order Thank you 
1,This McDonald s is one of the best The food is always prepared well I hate waiting in line but I never have to worry about that here Yes there are lines but the staff is fast and proficient and I always ask for my meals to be made fresh although it isn t always necessary Because of their popularity it always fresh and hot A good place to stop or pickup a good and hot fast meal 
1,I was on drive thru so it was all good
1,My friend and I ate here together and we both deem this to be the best McDonald s that we have ever been to Twice the manager came around to us to make sure that everything was going well That s a first for me at a McDonald s 
1,I had a BigMacAttack glad the sandwich was nearby this hour 
1,Clean premises Professional service Delicious food When it s less busy they ll come up to your table to check on your experience 
1,First time back since it was remodeled The girl in the drive thru was great Very friendly and personable 
1,Paid a visit to see the unique architecture Inside was small but very clean They accepted my coupon and my order was brought to my table quickly No complaints with my food but it seemed like someone was having trouble with an Uber Eats order My cashier was scolded by the manger for being too cold or rude to some co workers he kept repeating treat everyone like an equal

1,As always McDonald s prices are good for your pocketbook Bought it for my three little friends and they were very full And my wallet was very happy Very friendly employees as well 
1,Although it took longer than I expected to dine on there was actually service and concern from the attentive staff And I really like the burgers I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the bottom bun To cut carbs If you do it quickly the cheese doesn t melt so it very easy to go openfaced

1,If you like McDonalds this is s good one I like McDonalds

1,The interior was something I d never seen before There were planted boards you could use to place your order before reaching the counter but the line was short so it wasn t needed The place was clean and all the orders were right It was a nice stop for a sit down quick lunch like how fast food should be 
1,I ll always come back here The food s always right and the store and bathroom is always clean Nobody bothers you I even ate pizza here and the management didn t seem to care and it s a good place to eat and work There aren t too many good McDonald s you can find a good plug in for your laptop but this one is awesome The staff is good and very helpful every time I go there One day I was low on money but really had to eat One of the guys who worked there gave me a break and upsized my drink as a courtesy It was hot as h t outside and I had a longer lasting drink to curve the heat 
1,Actually an especially above average location Service and food are what should be expected Clean Restroom has hands free door opener Kids Play Place is especially nice Has modern play equipment toddler area and interactive life size video game station

1,Best McDonald s around The people who work there are always super nice the service is very good compared to other McDonald s in this area And there are NOT any of those horrible self serve kiosks Oh how I hate those things The restaurant is clean and we ll maintained This is my favorite 
1,Every once in awhile you just got to have a quarter pounder Today it was a quarter pounder with fries and a Coke So good The Quarter Pounders are made with fresh meat now and you can really taste the difference And everyone knows that McDonald s has the best Fountain Coke They tested a couple of times per hour just to ensure the formula is Right Plus they have those nice fat straws that make for big sips 
1,We did dine in But used the app to order the food and it was ready in a reasonable time We also got to enjoy the AC and sit inside and eat 
1,They made a mistake on my order but I hadn t left the parking lot yet I called them and told them and they gave me the correct sandwich right away Great service

1,I ve ubered and ordered at this particular McDonald s and I ve always had a positive experience They don t ignore you and they actually get to their customers in the order that they are in Great team up there and positive work attitude 
1,Who doesn t love McDonalds fries quick service it always fast not really a long wait Mmmmmm fries 
1,Love this spot Convenient location right off of major highways food is prepared properly drive thru turns over quickly coffee is delicious No complaints This is what every McDonald s should be like 
1,Fast service hot fries fresh burgers It s McD s Somehow the food is fresher in our drive thru only world People at this one always are nice considering they need to deal with peeps like me that never know what they want It s been the same basic menu for decades LOL
1,If you don t know what you re getting into when you go to a McDonald s you re probably coloring more often than reading My Sprite tasted EXACTLY like Sprite 
1,I wouldn t normally write a review especially for a McDonalds that I go to often but recently I have been going through the drive through and have seen a man that has twice as much enthusiasm as anybody else working there I believe his name is Brandon but every time I go he always seems to brighten my day 
1,Some people still swear that McDonald s has the best coffee It s not my personal favorite but it s good and inexpensive Discounts for seniors Love the value meal selections too 
1,The kiddos love to stop by and play in the play places This location has a bathroom in the play area which is awesome for the potty training years The resturant and play area was very clean and staff was around every so often to check on the cleaniness This is one of our favorite locations to visit 
1,They were wicked fast and very friendly I had actually stopped going to any McDonalds because of bad experiences elsewhere with really dry nuggets Did not regret getting food there today 
1,I just want to say MCDonalds does NOT take phone orders also you would not believe the amount of prank calls they get a night There hasn 
1,They are doing a remodel for the lobby But the drive through was open Associate was very nice and we had a nice conversation while waiting on the food 
1,THE STAFF WAS KIND AND COURTEOUS THEY QUICKLY CORRECTED MY ORDER WHEN I RECEIVED IT WITHOUT KETCHUP OR BBQ SAUCE
1,You are sure of a good meal every time Had a great brunch there today 
1,My over year experience with McDonald s Restaurants in this area Southlake Grapevine Keller Northlake and north FW This one is by far the best one I have been eating food regularly from this Roanoke McDonald s for a little over a year now This is the only place that makes the Big Mac the way I remember it as a kid I do not post reviews often at all I am making this one because of my experiences at all of the area McDonalds If you decide to eat McDonald s go to this one 
1,That was the best quarter pounder I ve had in years for real Every once in awhile it s great I would have taken a picture but I wasn t thinking Picture perfect
1,Great neighborhood McD It s not open but has enough friendly staff to keep its drive through going while quickly serving your order if you re inside 
1,Good food friendly service and pretty quick as well
1,Guys just to let you know I hate McDonald s I just keep coming back and knowing that s its killing me What I m trying to say is that im addicted and I cant stop eating I eat because I m unhappy and I m unhappy cause I eat Lol star
1,Iced mocha is awesome they make it just right 
1,Good drive thru setup Orders have been correct every time 
1,Best mc Donalds EVA they made for me fresh coffee super quick and the cookies were just baked you made my night guys 
1,Extremely busy Friday night and everybody was busting their butt working so hard This needs to be acknowledged They have earned more than five stars Great job everyone 
1,Good price clean and good services
1,It s McDonald s One of the most ratchetest places you can visit for fast food
1,Very tasty and very unhealthy Perfect for weight gain and problems with digestion system Still worth it Try Double Quater Pounder Cheese it was amazing 
1,What can I say Buy extra fries before bringing your kids their meals By the time you get home you have devoured all the fries 
1,This place is absolutely delicious The fries have a perfect amount of salt The prices are very fair Customers and employees very polite and sophisticated This place should have the Kardashians swarming around I mean it s boogie people good for cheap 
1,My go to spot for my son and I to get our hash brown before he has class 
1,It s been a while that I haven t went to McDonald s and we had just came out from a bar and wanted to eat my sister wanted White Castle put in the order cuz we weren t sure McDonald s was open and she had a craving for a Big Mac so sorry White Castle but we left them went to McDonald s order and at in the morning One of the freshers big bags and Fries that I haven t had in a long time it hits the spot no regrets not going to White Castle and it was quick the order and to get the food it was worth the trip
1,no experience I just couldn t wait to home I m greedy

1,I needed a quick meal will on break at the Gaylord Palm business convention Pros any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land They keep the same consistent taste world wide as a business owner this is admirable This location was efficient and fast Cons we all know it s not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location So I only ate it once on my day stay McDonald s should explore healthier options for the current market But still a great experience out of Stars 
1,Always clean and super fast ordering on the app
1,First time I had been to a McDonald s in America It s certainly nothing special but there isn t anything wrong with the location Food was fine and it was cool to try the different items from the menu Also yes french fries taste the same whether you buy them from the UK or America 
1,I will admit this was a first at this location as it is always so busy when I arrived there was a line almost out to the street and this is a double drive through was worried I would be there a while but only took about ten mins as they moved quick and to my surprise my fries were fresh and hot Best fries I have had in a while Also got a cheeseburger and I must admit I was also pleased as I hate it when I decide to actually eat calories and my cheese is thrown in my hamburger and not even melted yucky But all was right on this last time Good cheez burg

1,This McDonald s was excellent the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald s I have been to It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant no matter where I go in America so far there is a better than chance that the coffee for example will be the same thing I am use to and desire 
1,The workers are pleasant and the food here is always hot and good 
1,Quick service accurate follow up
1,They had a broken latte machine The kiosk already had our CC deposit It took very long to receive our CC refund because the manager had to perform the business and the restaurant was overly crowded They used to make great cappuccinos but it got to be too loud and those machines broke more frequently than lattes

1,For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonald s it s the biggest and the best If you re looking for customer service not a chance You re better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order I ll recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children 
1,This McDonald s was awesome I ve never been to a McDonald s where the service was so good and the food options were amazing 
1,The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic Try it sometime it s wonderful thank you very much and God bless 
1,I put in an order for in store pickup but didn t realize that the dining room closed at The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly Great customer service 
1,It s McDonald 
1,Friendly fast service Kiosks made it easy to place your order The food was delicious and hot Very busy location but hardly no wait The dining area was nice and clean 
1,Always friendly staff Fairly clean and food to order Shout out to all workers and managers 
1,Being in the area this is a must see place Had a great meal overall It was busy but got almost all our food very quick but the pizza Quite understandable that the pizza would take longer but the only thing is that by the time it arrived my fries were almost cold No big deal but they should keep that in mind Other than that the pizza was great and service was good I ve worked McDonald 
1,We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team What an experience There s a lot of different food options including PIZZA The place is amazing If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place Unbelievable 
1,Great Mcdonalds Really love the clean store the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders Highly recommend this store if you re in the area The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive the road is pretty interesting at times In conclusion I rate this McDonald s and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs 
1,Right place at the right time It was a wonderful drive thru experience right choice given those inside Very busy in Orlando but food was fresh exactly what I needed going back to Tampa 
1,Fast and friendly service The food was hot and we ordered through the app which saved time Customer service was amazing 
1,Good food good service and delivered quickly I must admit I am a fan of the milkshakes and apple pie
1,Good place to go after some drinks Food fresh Food hot recommend Thank you McDonald 
1,Quick pop through the drive thru for a cold drink after visiting Fun Spot Frozen coke products are amazing and so was the cinnamon roll 
1,Food came out really fast and on point Games were very affordable for min of play Will definitely come back Kids and loved the experience 
1,This is the world s biggest McDonald s and has several options not available anywhere else like oven bake pizza and pasta Also the dessert section has gelato and cakes
1,Friendliest service I have ever experienced The Coffee tastes great Could even use their phone for a car rental call since my car broke down Also it is very clean during my waiting time of hours they cleaned the tables several times I fully recommend to visit this place 
1,Quick and easy using the order yourself tower Fish ole sandwich was delicious Thank you 
1,The biggest Macdonald I ever saw They are selling pizza as well
1,Chris working the first window at the drive thru tonight is PHENOMENAL I frequent the drive through at this location and this is the first time I ve received actual customer service If the restaurant I managed wasn 
1,It is a very nice place and the service is great the taste of the food is different from other McDonald s in my opinion 
1,This location offers pizza pasta and more It has an arcade on the nd floor that acts as the play area This McDonald s is the largest McDonald s and is close to both amusement parks Therefore it will always be a go to stop for me on vacation The pizza at McDonald s is freshly baked to perfection by a McPit Master
1,Everything was great Food was good and fresh Place was clean All the employees were very nice to us and attentive Especially Patrick on the second floor he was amazing Kept everything clean the whole time ask us how we were a few time and was very kind and polite the whole time and takes very seriously his duties Me and my kids enjoy our time a lot 
1,This place was amazing Had fish tanks it made pasta It was so quick everyone was very friendly It had a whole upper level for kids to play and was ao clean 
1,Average mcdonalds They get the order right out of times which is a good success rate in my experience 
1,Who doesn t love a Mcdonald s had a late breakfast ie a big mac and massive coffee ou
1,We were looking for a certain happy meal toy to complete our collection and Emma was nice enough to help us and even search for it It really made our night and she was awesome Update this is the International Dr location
1,The guy that works the window taking orders is hilarious and nice I think his name is Sidel He is an amazing person and made our night in the short encounters we had 
1,Hello everyone First I have to say that I have not been to McDonald s in forever With that being said I went through the drive thru because I didn t want to get out The young man who took my order was kind that was the first window nd window a whole other story Drive up and right off the bat this young lady looks mad that she is even working You know at least fake that you are Blessed to even have a job I was scared to ask her for a cup holder but I did any way lol I had the BigMac Meal and remember like I said I had not been in forever I DEVOURED THAT BIG MAC it Was fresh and so were the fries I also had a Fish sandwich So yes I recommend 
1,Excellent customer service fresh food and juice Recommend 
1,We went drive through this location and had a good experience 
1,Great experience The food was great but the real experience was the customer service Destiny was super helpful and even overheard us talking about asking for extra syrup for the pancakes and went and got it for us without us even having to ask Customer service sometimes seems like a thing of the past but not at this McDonald s Also when I spoke to the manager about the great experience he was very nice as well Great McDonald s All McDonald s should be modeled after this one Thank you guys 
1,The manager who i believes named chandler and one of the chashiers named Que where both amazing and made this experience unforgettable If you re looking for a hour place to eat you found it The food was great quick 
1,Love the new ordering system From using the easy to use order point to our food arriving it was less than minutes Only with we could get mcgriddles in the UK 
1,Celebrating my daughter s th birthday by nearby hotel Lunch was perfect with the game room pla
1,Our little one was having a pretty rough morning and Ms Maria stepped in and went above and beyond to try to make her happy Margot ended up smiling and dancing and even ended up passing out a few high fives Ms Maria made all of our days better Thank you for bringing a smile to our faces The location service was prompt our order from the kiosk was accurate and the food was well prepared Clean location and restrooms at am on a Thursday 
1,Had a pleasant trip here with my year old On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonald s there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean food was fresh tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually don t freeze there s like back at home Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom doing paperwork five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home 
1,My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table I noticed I didn t have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn t on the tray either I let her know and she apologized then comes back with not one but hash browns which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now She comped a free hashbrown She was such a pleasant person to deal with Her customer service and customer care abilities are I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn t her usual location and she is a General Manager She took care of evryone around us with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face which is a rare occasion I hope she gets the recognition she deserves and a promotion or raise She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one It s funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up 
1,Love their new chicken tenders it s about time McD s start picking up their game 
1,We only went through the drive through 
1,The employees were very nice 
1,Visiting from out of town I was very impressed with the manager Stephanie She really stood out to me today because she was working very hard and every customer that came her way she made sure she assisted them with out rushing them even though they were very busy She also took the time to pick up in lobby to keep the inside looking good Thanks for that experience today Step 
1,Always call here after visiting Seaworld It s half the price of the food in Seaworld We order on the App before we leave and it is brought to our vehicle minutes after we arrive nice and hot My orders have been accurate since using the App vs the drive through 
1,Breana on the amusements kiosk has made our evening giving her time to explain loading the amusement cards up really kind and helpful and nothing was rushed or too much trouble my children really loved her and all the way home said how nice she was We ve had bad experiences in this mcdonalds long waits for happy meals etc but i think she easily changed those for us today I hope she gets recognised for how good she s been 
1,Good service tucked away
1,This place is amazing clean place nice employees and they have updated there technology I 
1,Wow it 
1,Some of the negative reviews I m seeing might be for other I Drive locations This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good It s a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando 
1,Updated review This really is a great McDonald s Maybe if you don t appreciate it you haven t been around The grounds are clean I saw the manager Chris picking up trash around the store They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE ya ll It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby I think service is pretty fast Review I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot place clean and staff prompt and courteous Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning 
1,It s a busy McDonald s in the morning based on its location however their service is good and fast Great place to dine in 
1,Order was accurate and tasted great Fast service They were out of some items so had to change our order slightly 
1,Love this place
1,Very modern McDonald s plenty of self service kiosks drive through is efficient and they even have a patio so you can eat outside They also have table service Place was very clean too and the soda machine had dozens and dozens of combinations 
1,They where A they where closing still let us come in served us all it was a lot of us served us like we where they st customers alllll food was hot 
1,Visited a few days after Christmas it was a quick walk from our hotel Considering the amount of people that were ordering our food came out quick They forgot some items and they were very apologetic and got the rest of our order right away 
1,Fries and nuggets were hot and fresh I got the family share about nuggets nuggets and large fries Plus the off with mobile app Great deal 
1,We had breakfast this morning and was greeted by a manager in a suit who helped us place our order on the kiosk Our hot fresh food was brought to our table by a friendly associate While we ate I couldn t help but notice a manager holding doors for customers and assisting where needed even window washing A male associate asked if he could take our tray when we were finished The staff is impressive and the remodel looks refreshing
1,McDonald s is my favorite restaurant of all My dad or mom always order something we like Mine is the double cheeseburger with no pickles In Saturdays and mostly Fridays we get those burgers for dinner Like to see McDonald s keeping up the good work 
1,The manager here always is very accommodating and always makes sure that the place is clean 
1,Best McDonalds in the area Great coffee modern decor clean Wifi Quickest service Friendly and helpfull staff 
1,They have a arcade and place to play for kids of all ages staff swerves you and very helpful definitely my go to place when In Florida

1,The nicest workers I have ever met The main lady I didn t catch her name but she was so friendly and helped my family order on their touch screens and she was so nice and helpful It is refreshing to meet someon
1,Very nice clean establishment The staff was efficient and worked diligently to provide for our every need My family and I are visiting from out of town We noticed that the employees even the store manager walked throughout the restaurant checking on customers making sure they are enjoying their food I greatly appreciate the atmosphere they provide for their customers 
1,The staff here were amazing so kind to my two children Everyone we encountered was friendly and went out of their way to help 
1,Very clean Inside and out I order on my app and the food was waiting as I walked in Everything was hot and fresh 
1,Good fast location They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car It was super convenient and it did seem to save time We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over You can t really go wrong with cheeseburgers 
1,It is very clean inside great staff I always go inside and order take out They do everything super fast 
1,The cleanest nicest McDonald s ever The staff are so welcoming and helpful and great with the kids after a long tired day Thank you

1,Had a slight issue ordering Inform the manager that they re ordering system was not working right They jumped on it right away to correct the problem with getting it involved Super clean and friendly store 
1,Nothing bad to say here We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order It also seems to give you a little more time to order The place was very clean and modern in design We didn t interact too much with staff but the little we did they seemed very nice and helpful Although not used this time by us I did notice a cart specifically for sauces seasonings etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience 
1,Very nice staff good place to get all your fast food needs Tha k you 
1,They have better food than the regular McDonald s because it s the largest in the u s 
1,I love that you could touch screen order it was easy and there are people constantly cleaning I love that they bring the food to the table as well Very nice wish I had one where I love I think more people would enjoy dining in at McDonald s now 
1,I never thought I would rate a McDonald s as stars but I did Food was typical of a McDonald s but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant They smiled checked up on us cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations 
1,This place was freaking unbelievable It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins The food was good I had the broccoli and Alfredo I do recommend it The large fish tank in the middle of the floor

1,Although McDonald s chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery however this outlet is different They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers Moreover they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment

1,It s McDonald s doesn t matter the city the food is all the same double cheeseburgers and a fry Perfect lunch on the go

1,This location is near the city Zoo It is beautifully themed with majestic animals We enjoyed that they made the interior a learning environment The service was good too which was very refreshing This location features a play area as well Our orders were correct That is miraculous considering the multiple errors we normally see when placing fast food orders We felt welcomed 
1,Since it re opened I go for breakfast about once a week Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonald s anywhere in the country its so perfectly crispy every time My order has always been correct The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long 
1,We had a small birthday party for my year old at the play place and they were more than accomadating The area was clean and a worker came and helped us clean up after the fact without prompting Super nice of them 
1,Loved this place kids area was great it was nice and cold inside great after a hot day at the zoo and food was ready fast even with our big order
1,Hey yo got that buy one get one for a buck My piece nuggets almost gone Bru Taking this Big Mac for a buck home Bru hahahahaha Psi chopathicpeppamintpimpin

1,The man that takes the order is great he been there for years He s great 
1,I went inside with my kids and being that it s next to the zoo the inside decor is made to look like we re at the zoo My kids loved sitting at the table while we waited for our food The employees were friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time The restrooms were clean as well I recommend it 
1,It s a McDonald s with a Zoo twist If you are reading this review you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside More importantly though is how efficient this location is Every time I ve been through I ve seen a drive through cars deep and watched them churn through everyone s orders in a matter of minutes If only every drive through was this efficient 
1,I am changing my review from star to stars after my recent two visits Mar This McDonald s has gone through a major overhaul Newly remodeled inside and out including employees Employees are very polite and welcoming even asked how my day was going and talked about the weather 
1,McDonald 
1,They had my food very fresh
1,The young man wearing the black mask that said king on it taking orders today during lunch was absolutely awesome His Customer service was on point and he was extremely pleasant The food was correct all across the board and we couldnt have left any happier He needs some sort of recognition for an awesome job well done He made the rest of the store look good today 
1,The employees staff were friendly and polite 
1,I didn t eat here but stopped to use the restroom on the way to DFW It seemed clean overall I enjoyed the jungle theme It was inmersive right down to Lions and Lionesses on the bathroom doors Somewhat of a weird location just off the freeway exit lots of construction in the area when we stopped by 
1,Was blown away fast and fresh food was little bummed they took animals out
1,The service was good The young girl assisting me was polite Their playground is huge and air conditioned And its decorated nicely We liked the tables with animals on them My kids have been begging to come in here They loved it 
1,Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous Great Dine in was not available yet I am looking forward to seeing the inside Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo 
1,They actually have a play area which most McDonald s don t anymore We also loved the animals inside and outside

1,I buy my drinks there The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile even the homeless Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on Robert B Cullom in South dallas and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me Since I haven t heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonald s

1,For the first time I see such a McDonald s made either under Madagascar or just like the Jungle The lion growls the elephant trumpets periodically the boa constrictor hisses the children like it But there is no self order screen Civilization apparently has not yet reached this forest with animals 
1,It s so cool Have animals inside like an anaconda giraffe monkeys and the guys are so gently You can take ur kids to eat before going to the zoo I think it s cheaper than inside zoo It s grea

1,Fast service Even tho lines be long at night service is quickly I rarely heard them say they are out of any products like most do at night I have not yet tried an hot or cold coffee at night there hopefully the machines still works since thru are on a very busy and tourist spot very safe to go to at night 
1,Restaurant was clean Ordering at a kiosk was pretty impersonal but the cashier was nice I didn t like my breakfast choice it looked like an english muffin with sausage But the muffin was very soft and tasted like syrup Yuck My sweet tea was weak at best However everyone else with me enjoyed their meal Bathroom was clean too

1,Looks like they renovated since I last went person taking order was pleasant despite heavy orders bit of a wait in drive through because of number of cars
1,Love frappes at this location Sometimes there is not good service I think is due to covid We have to wait until the situation gets better with a full staff so I can give a more objective review 
1,Oh yes Love Mc Donald s sense little however I am Bother by The San Andreas Fault line Going To Separate Not Enough Sewers To Drain The Ocean Water Of It Done might create a Domino AffectThe Great Wall of America The San Andreas Fault line Emergency Plan SCUBA GEAR BEFORE THE SAM ANDREAS FAULT LINE SEPARATE CASH APP GODHEADDIVA
