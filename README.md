README

The file to run in a python script file called generate.py.

For the program to run, make sure to have a training file named "train_file.txt" and a testing file (to be predicted) named "testing_file.txt". 

As the program runs, to save time in future runs, it will save the files "tokens.csv" and "tokens_test.csv" which are files holding the tokenized forms of the train and test text files. 

To run the program, type "python3 generate.py" along with the supporting text files in the same folder. 

The program will output a file called "result.txt" which holds the predictions of each test file line in a txt file.
